This movie predates some of ██████'s more critically acclaimed and popularly received turns, but in truth, this may be the finest acting job of his career. ██████ is this film, and he has made this kind of intense, honest character study his own (Tender Mercies, The Apostle, The Great Santini). The black and white cinematography is perfectly suited to the story and the acting. It works as a far more honest story-telling device than █████████'s "Schindler's List." This is a must-see for ██████ fans and for fans of small, independent films as well.
