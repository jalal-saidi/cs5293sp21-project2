In the 1950's there were many film boigraphies: For me 4 are memorable: Interrupted Melody with ███████████████ The Great Caruso with ████████████ With A Song In My Heart with █████████████ and Love Me or Leave Me with Doris Day...Im commenting here on the last mentioned. what a film what a cast...what music !!!Saw this when I was @ 9yrs old, and never forgot...the sets the costumes, and █████████... what an underraed talent... with all her wonderful films, has only been █████ nominated once, acted beautifully and sang her heart out! Strange that 2 other biopics I mentioned,neither Ms. ███████ nor Ms. ██████ did their own singing.. and both were oscar nominated!!(love them both but █████ did it all) She has never won a major award!!Cmon █████ its time to honor Doris Day with a special █████ she more than deserves!! and Grammy shouldnt Doris Day be in the Hall of Fame by now ? Her recordings incl. soundtrack of █████ sold millions, Que Sera Sera Secret Love... Love you █████ you deserve to be honored and recognized!! also ████████████ was brilliant as well/good chemistry between both leads... buy the video/ get the soundtrack.. if available. i still have my original vinyl lp with that great Doris Day cover !!Love this film !!
