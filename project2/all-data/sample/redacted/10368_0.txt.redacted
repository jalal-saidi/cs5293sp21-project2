Smug, anal, successful and ambitious detail-oriented Wall Street yuppie businessman ███████████ (exceptionally well played by ████████████ in his first lead role) has his cozy and comfortable life thrown out of whack when a large and crafty rat invades his fancy brownstone apartment. When conventional methods of extermination prove fruitless, the increasingly primal, obsessive and paranoid ████ resorts to more drastic vicious and barbarous measures in order to rid himself of this loathsome pest.<br /><br />Director ██████████████████, who also helmed the Sly ████████ action vehicles "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Cobra," wrings plenty of tension out of the creepy premise, expertly maintains a snappy pace throughout and stages the ample jolting shocks with a considerable amount of flair and skill. Moreover, the smart and trenchant script by █████████████ offers a potent, gripping and provocative allegory on "civilized" man's latent capacity for extreme violence and brutality needing the proper stimulus to be activated (the incredible conclusion with ██████ chasing the rodent around his posh abode while brandishing a spiked baseball bat is both disturbing and exciting in comparable measure). ██████'s outstanding intense performance easily carries the picture, with fine supporting turns by █████████████ as ██████'s concerned secretary, █████████████ as ██████'s tough, but fair and equally worried boss, Louis Del Grande as the macho building superintendent, gorgeous "Playboy" Playmate Shannon Tweed as Weller's hot babe wife, and █████████████ as a jerky co-worker. ██████████████ beautifully polished cinematography and ██████████████ supremely spooky'n'shivery score are both on the money effective and impressive. The rat is one genuinely scary and nasty piece of repulsive work. A total powerhouse.
