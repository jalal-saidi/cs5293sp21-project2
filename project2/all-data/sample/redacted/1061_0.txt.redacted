Slimy, disgusting aliens invade Earth. They attach themselves to peoples backs and control their minds. ██████████ (█████████), father █████████████ (█████████████████) and ███████████ (████████████) are all part of separate government agencies who join together to fight the invasion.<br /><br />Not a faithful adaptation of ████████'s book but still a good film in its own right. The script is good; it has realistic, believable characters; the aliens are agreeably disgusting and the action scenes are good and violent. Also, with the sole exception of ██████████ (who appears to be sleepwalking) all the acting is good--especially ████ (tall, handsome and hunky) and Warner (beautiful, intelligent and strong). A very good sci-fi film. Also, I agree with some previous posters--one of the best scenes in the film is ████'s nude shower scene. ████!
