If you want to see a film where Chevy and ██████ are really on top of their game, this is the one!<br /><br />"Seems Like Old Times" couldn't miss, really - here is a script by ██████████, a solid comedy cast (█████ as the befuddled judge is a stand-out) and a completely engaging feel for what comedic timing is. There are no slow spots, flat jokes or flopped sight gags anywhere throughout and what can one say about ██████? He's great, the modern day "stone-face" scores yet again!<br /><br />The lines are endlessly quotable and some are downright classic. My favorite has to be where ██████ has to do some quick thinking to explain to the cops why bank robber/ex-husband Chevy is in the back of her car. When the cops ask her driver (██████) if he'd seen any of what happened - "No, I came late."<br /><br />To tell anything else would be spoiler enough. This is a film that has to be experienced first-hand to be truly enjoyed. And if you like sight gags, one-liners and either ███████████, Chevy Chase or ██████████████, look no further for your favorite movie.<br /><br />Watch "Seems Like Old Times" - you'll have a GREAT time.<br /><br />Ten stars and a handful of Zagnut bars for this one. And remember - it's never a good idea in court to have a St. Bernard dribble on your briefs.
