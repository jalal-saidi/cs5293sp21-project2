There are a few times when you discover an actor who just gets the characters right. The Col. in Apcolypse Now is very real (I was a Marine). ███ in Loansome Dove (I was raised by cowboys). The lead in Tender Mercies (my cousin is a country western star), etc. In this hard to find film you will see a great actor ██████ at his early best. A great author who builds a penetrating study in ████████. A great screenwriter play-write director █████ (who worked many time with ██████ and knows how to show him at his best). These all come together in a very special way. A film that is for actors and people who get it... not for the ██████████ think it moves slow). This is a file for folks who see the little things that make craft Art. I Love the film and the black white works perfectly.
