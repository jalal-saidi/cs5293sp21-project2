I wouldn't say ████████████ comic wit is at full steam in this light-hearted comedy, but there are certainly a plethora of laughs to go around.<br /><br />Chevy Chase's █████████████ is offishly matter-of-fact funny as only he can be, a writer and journalist (have you noticed Simon's protagonists are nearly always writers?) of ill-repute who somehow once ended up in a Mexican jail for 2 years and is now on the path to recovery when a couple of bank robbers kidnap and use him for a heist. His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (████'s) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.<br /><br />The movie is mostly fast-paced slapstick farce, a host of retreaded clichés (the dogs, for example), and quick jokes. ██████████████ is actually quite funny and charming as her straight-arrow District Attorney (soon to be Attorney General) husband, ███. Given "Midnight Run," I think ██████ should be considered a mint for American glib comedy a la █████████████████ /><br />It's pointless to go much deeper into the story as the plot merely drives slapstick scenes one into the next. The story is essentially the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Goldie ████ is in full-tilt cutie mode (she really was a doll) but carries the movie very well as a hopeless do-gooder who wants to help everybody, including her ex-husband and every stray dog in 10 surrounding counties. Chevy Chase often gives the impression of making comedy look effortless (think ██████), but he is REALLY giving into pratfalling a la his SNL days in this one. The supporting cast with █████████ and others is excellent.<br /><br />This is completely worth a watch if you catch it as in many ways this movie is superior to the ████ and Chase hit "Foul Play."
