"Scandal Sheet" director ███████████'s "The Man with Nine Lives" qualifies as a good █████████████ mad scientist movie about the application of cryogenics as a cure for cancer. No, this is neither a scary movie nor is █████ buried beneath layers of make-up, though he does affect spectacles and a beard. ██████ and scenarists ██████████████ wrote "The Man They Could Not Hang" and "Counterfeit Lady" ██████████████ explore the thin line between scientific genius and criminal insanity in this provocative thriller. The depth of sophistication in the writing and ███████'s extraordinary performancehe waxes from a kind gentle soul to a demented madmansets "The Man with Nine Lives" apart from most horror movies. Later, in 1940, ███████ played a similar role as a scientist with greater sympathy in director ██████████████ "The Ape" where he resorts to horrible means to perfect a serum so that a wheel-chair bound beauty can stand up and walk again. Moreover, "The Man with Nine Lives" deals with something much more believable, the use of cryogenics to eliminate human ailments. Indeed, this low-budget opus considers the difference between scientific success and its real-life application. Just because an individual is right doesn't mean that they are morally justified to perform their deeds. For example, the protagonist, Dr. █████████ (███████████ of "Belle of the Nineties"), impresses to the press how the use of cryogenics can help mankind before his procedure has been checked by others and the head of the hospital reprimands him for behaving in a presumptuous manner and advises him to take a sabbatical until his experiments can be checked.<br /><br />Mason and his fiancée Nurse ████████████ (██████████████ of "Young Dr. ███████") use the leave of absence to track down the scientist, Dr. ████████████ (█████████████) whose research inspired Mason. ███████ has been missing since 1930 and Mason resolves to find him. ███████ lived on an island and a man who rents out boats warns them that several gentlemen visited Kravaal, but they never returned. Mason and Judith land on the island and find a destitute, empty house. The house, however, conceals many hiding places and they discover a dilapidated laboratory and ██████ shrieks when they stumble upon a skeleton. Later, our heroes uncover a locked down and open it to find it filled with ice and the body of Dr. ███████. They revive him and Mason explains his interest in cryogenics.<br /><br />Dr. ███████ explains how he came to be frozen. The circumstances involved a dying wealthy man who sought treatment for his ailment, but the man's hysterical son believes that ███████ is taking advantage of a terminal case to make money and the authorities force Kravaal to take him to his island so that they can see what he has done. A medical authority who accompanies them has nothing but contempt for ███████'s treatment of freezing a man to cure him. ███████ gets the drop on them and smashes a chemical potion that knocks them out. Their interference brings about the death of the dying rich man and ███████ stashes them in one of his frozen chambers. Unfortunately, the same chemicals that he resorted to so that he could take them hostage works on him and he collapses and is frozen until Mason and ██████ thaw him out. They thaw out the incredulous authorities and the adventure really begins! This is a really thoughtful science fiction movie.
