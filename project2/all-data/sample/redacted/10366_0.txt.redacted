████████████ anchors a cast of Canadian actors in this entertaining low budget thriller directed by ███████████████. Plenty of action and a good through line of how an obsessively detailed individual would battle a threat to his environment. ████████████████████████████████ is very good as the helpful janitor next door to ██████'s yuppie palace. Features rising Canadian actors █████████████, █████████████ and a slimmer █████████████. The Canadian Tax Credit system helped put this film in Montreal, doubling as New York. With little to work with in terms of sets and exteriors, ████████ shows his chops as a director who tries to make each shot pay off in a particular way. The overhead shot of ██████ looking out over the "human" rat race crossing the street draws an interesting parallel with the main story. More than a couple of 'homages' to Jaws, which ████████ admits was one of his favourite movies.A bit repetitive at times but better than '███████'. Worth a look.
