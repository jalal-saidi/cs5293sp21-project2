Actually, this is an excellent, character driven horror movie made by the creators of Hill Street Blues, which aired 2 years later. Suffice it to say, you have ████████████ ("The Exorcist")creating another of his too little seen angst ridden characters and E.G. ████████ as an old cop playing ███████████, teaming up in search of a vampire uprooted when a construction crew unwittingly release him. It has brains, style and a surprisingly literate script for a change. Again, you get character over MTV videos like those found in the almost unwatchable and campy Lost Boys.<br /><br />Thank God for 1970's movie-making! True, you have a ham of the grind house, █████████████ (good in "Scarecrows"), but he is better here as the vampire than you'd expect. At least it was not ███████████! For more of this quality, see "The Night Stalker" (a true classic, ███████████ "███████" with a fine ████████████, and ███████████ "Death Dream". Oh ██████ throw in Soprano's creator ███████████'s strange drive in flick "Grave of the Vampire" for good measure (not nearly as good though).<br /><br />Sadly, the only as yet released version of this film is a 12 year old VHS tape put out at SLP speed to boot! The above films are all on DVD---let's get this one out there already, huh? Shame on whoever has the rights and has been sitting on it.
