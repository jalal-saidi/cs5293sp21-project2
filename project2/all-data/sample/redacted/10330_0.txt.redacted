This is a tour de force for ██████████████████ - her performance alone makes this worth watching. <br /><br />Things begin with █████ (████████) and her husband ████ (████████████) heading out of Paris to their summer home in the country. In following the mundane activities of their trip and first night away we learn quite a bit about them. The rhythms of their married life have long since been grooved. █████'s attachment to ████ is apparent, but ████'s feelings for █████ are less well established and this becomes a relevant plot element.<br /><br />On the day after their arrival at the summer home the couple go to the beach. While ██████████ herself, ████ goes for a swim and he does not come back. █████ goes through all of the expected reactions - waiting anxiously, calling the police, witnessing the search, and finally giving up. It is here that we move into the deeper waters of the story, as it were. The expressions on ████'s face just prior to his going on the swim sets the tone of ambiguity as to the cause of his vanishing. Was his disappearance an accident, suicide, or ███████████ /><br />Marie deals with this bewildering situation by entering into a state of denial and this is where ████████ and Ozon boost this movie beyond the ordinary as they subtly trace the gradual chipping away of █████'s illusions. The reaction shots of █████'s seeing an older man swimming in a pool, or receiving a recorded message that a body has been found, are powerful in their understatement. The use of lighting to accentuate █████'s moods is quite effective, like the use of harsh white light when she is in obvious agony.<br /><br />Rampling is at the top of her form and she completely puts to rest any idea that a woman in her 50s cannot be sexy.<br /><br />The subtext of how █████'s friends try to deal with her reactions is engaging, making you wonder about the best way to deal with a friend in a state of denial. You want to be supportive, but also want to encourage them to face what you think are the realities of the situation.<br /><br />Relationships are always more complicated than the participants understand and, as is the case here, a traumatic event can unleash emotions and thoughts previously unexplored. I took the ambiguous ending to personify the hopes, fears, and unknowables in █████'s relationship with ████, and maybe in all significant relationships.
