Great stunts, decent story, good fight scenes, but some of the action was just plain silly. Most ███████████ movies try WAY too hard to be funny, and this one is no exception. It just isn't funny and the attempts are silly and unintelligent. They should just stick to fighting and stunts and they'll be fine. ███████████ is terrible at comedy.
