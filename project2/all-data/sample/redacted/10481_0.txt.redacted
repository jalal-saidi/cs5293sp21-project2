If ███████████████ was alive, he'd have a copy of Trees Lounge in his video library. This is a story that is hard to tell, let alone find an audience. Although many can relate with the cast of lost souls hanging out at a bar most of the day, many will not admit to being somewhat connected to any of the characters. Filmed for less that 2 million, this independent, low budget, and somewhat of a masterpiece is brilliant as well as entertaining. Much of the cast has gone on to do other known films. ██████████, ██████████ Junior █████████████, ██████████████, ████████████████ and █████'s brother ███████████████ star in this ██████ and █████████ type story. ███████████████ and ███████████ add their touch of magic to this story as well. A deep story with deep characters, this is a movie worth watching.
