TREES LOUNGE is a film about █████████████ , an unemployed mechanic who spend most of his time drinking in a bar or snorting drugs . " What`s so compelling about this movie ? " you ask , well I think you`ve hit the nail on the head with that question because there`s nothing really compelling about TREES LOUNGE . It`s a really low concept ( ie character based story ) movie where not much happens . Written , directed and starring █████████████ it feels like one of those indie projects actors come up with now and again to increase their cred with major Hollywood studios and I`m guessing ███████ ploughed much of his own money into the project so maybe I shouldn`t be too critical <br /><br />!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!<br /><br />I should perhaps also give some praise to ███████ for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want : █████ want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , █████ wants to take a woman ████ picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear . Such a pity realism takes precedence over an exciting plot
