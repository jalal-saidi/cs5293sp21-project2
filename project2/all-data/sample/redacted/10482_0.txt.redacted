There are plenty of movies I can think of that I wished were a little (or a lot) shorter. Trees Lounge however presents ███ with one of the rare movies that I wish were longer. I wanted this movie to keep going, I wanted to see what else would happen to the characters. While the film doesn't entirely paint the happy bar room existence that ██████ did it does make a pretty accurate portrail of good portion of the drinkers culture. Every actor in this movie hits just the right note especially █████████████, who has never looked more fetching. One of those silly ████████ even turns in a fine performance. █████████████ wrote and directed this movie and I shall be rather intrested in any subsequent work he does in either field.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
