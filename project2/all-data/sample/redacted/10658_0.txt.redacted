████████████████████ and Zoetrope Studios went nearly bankrupt for this movie and it's worth every tear they must have shed! Having built the entire Las Vegas strip inside an enormous sound stage (which cost many $), ███████ was able to control every little visual nuance (just like the master, ███████). ███████ created neon sunsets and an electric glow to bathe his cris-crossed little love story about two people looking for magic in fantasy land. Songs by █████████ and sung as ironic commentary by Waits and █████████████ add an extra cynical spice.
