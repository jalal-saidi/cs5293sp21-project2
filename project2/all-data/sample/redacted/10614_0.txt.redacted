An aging film director returns quickly from Madrid to Buenos Aires when he learns of his nineteen-year old son's drug overdose. When summoned to the boy's bedside, ██████ believes his son has tried to commit suicide, although the facts are unclear. What is apparent, however, is that the director (███████████████), known only as ██████, has distanced himself from his family, hiding his emotions to those who looked to him for support: his son, his mistress ██████ (████████████), and his gay actor friend █████ (███████████████). Potentially melodramatic, Argentinean director ███████████████████ (A Place in the World) Martin (Hache), handles the material with skill and intelligence and, while the dialogue often sounds like tedious psychodrama, impeccable performances by █████ and ████ make ██████ extremely watchable.<br /><br />Juan Diego Botto is ██████'s son, known as Hache (Junior) or ███ in the English subtitles. Though quite intelligent, ███ does not work or go to school and his only interest seems to be playing the guitar. Feeling unwanted by both parents, rejected by his girlfriend, and thinking that he has let his father down by underachieving, he resorts to a potentially lethal combination of drugs and booze that almost end his young life. ██████ is persuaded by his ex-wife to take ███ back to Madrid though he is leery of having to once again assume the responsibilities of fatherhood.<br /><br />Taking on a new project, he soon leaves for the south of Spain to find film locations, leaving ███ with █████ and his girlfriend ██████, both heavy drug users. Soon, █████ and ██████ meet ██████ at a seaside resort, hoping for a new sense of intimacy. It is soon clear that not much has changed. ██████ refuses to give of himself, distancing the people around him with outbursts of anger and cynicism and the result leads to tragedy. The conclusion, however, is a bittersweet reminder that transformation can come instantly once difficult choices are faced.
