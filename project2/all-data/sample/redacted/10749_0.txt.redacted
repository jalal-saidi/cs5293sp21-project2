This movie was extremely funny! ███████████ is always hilarious at getting into bad situations, like being forced to rob a bank and becomes a fugitive. Chase stars as a writer named █████████████, who is the ex-husband of ████'s character, █████████████████████ who has re-married a District Attorney named ███. ████ desperately needs ██████'s help to hide from the police. She reluctantly hides him at her house, and he is always so close to being caught by her new husband. I love when ██████ and ███ are trying to have dinner with the Governor, and ████ poses as a waiter. Will ████ be able to prove his innocence and still get his ex-wife to love him again? I highly recommend SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES!!!
