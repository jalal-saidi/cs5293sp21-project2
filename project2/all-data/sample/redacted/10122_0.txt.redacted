In time of colonization of America, the widower ████████████ (██████████████) lives in an isolated farm in the woods with his son Davey (█████████). Father and son miss their wife and mother █████, who has recently died, and █████ concludes that he needs a woman to educate his son properly and to cook and clean the house. █████ decides to travel with █████ to the nearby fort to seek a woman and the reverend proposes the bond servant ██████ (█████████████) for him. █████ buys ██████, and █████ overhears the negotiation; but the reverend demands that they should marry to each other to have a decent life in the same house. The trio travels back to the farm and David and Davey treat Rachel like a slave without any respect or affection. When █████'s drifter friend ████████████ (██████████████) visits them, he stays for a couple of days with the family and treats ██████ respectfully like a lady. Then ███ courts ██████, and David feels jealous and realizes how important she is for him. <br /><br />"Rachel and the Stranger" is an adorable romance and I loved this western. I did not know the concept of indentured servant in America, and the humiliating situation of ██████ is heartbreaking, fruit of the unpaid debts of her father. █████████████ has a fantastic performance and ██████████████ and ██████████████ have hilarious moments with their witty lines. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Rachel e o Estranho" ("Rachel and the Stranger")
