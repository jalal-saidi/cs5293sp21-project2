This is one of my favorite films. <br /><br />Terribly sincere, talks about relationships and silence, about how doubts and questions not answered can turn love in death or slow suicide and about how everything comes to pain. <br /><br />But is not a sad story at the end. The role of young ██████ (Hache), perfect and tender ████████████████, as the real survivor of the script, turning sour into sweetness, and insecurity into strenght, even though he's lost in hesitations, is a message of faith in life.<br /><br />The dialogs are intelligent and sharp, the actors, gorgeous. And I fell in love with Martín (Hache) for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Thank you, █████████████████ for such a great, sensitive, risky and intelligent movie and thank you, █████████████, ████████████, ███████████████ and, specially, ████████████████ for your incredible work.
