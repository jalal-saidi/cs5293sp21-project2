█████████████ stars as ███████████ in this action movie (which is actually a remake of "Bloodfist"). He arrives in L.A., only to find that his brother, who used to take part in "back-alley" fights, has been murdered. In order to find the killer, he becomes a fighter himself. Marcus Aurelius stars as Pep, the man who trains ████ to fight. 1993's "Dragon Fire" (Starring ███████████████, Dir: █████████████) also has the same story, but this movie is better. The fight scenes are good. I gave this 8/10.
