"Night Nurse" is my favorite film , in a big way sister! This movie contains humor on various levels. ████████████████ and █████████████ are 2 tough broads who can hold their own against the evil Doctor ███████ and even "Nick The Chauffeur" played by ███████████. It does help to be an actual pediatric night nurse to understand this movie to its full potential. The camp is both intentional and unintentional. The movie has a rebel flair with the nurses mouthing off to authority and even befriending a bootlegger (who is one of the heroes of the film).The movie is pre-code so it's pretty spicy for the 30's . You can even see ███████ and ████ in their skivvies.The medical lingo is very amusing. ██████████████████ character has "blood type 4h" and they got some very pudgy little kids to play the starving children. I own the video and have passed it along to co-workers who are also pediatric night nurses and it has become a cult favorite amongst my collegues.
