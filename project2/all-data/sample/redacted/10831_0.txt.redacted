Great movie! Yes, it's a knock-off of "Deliverance" (good movie also), but this movie is worth your while. It has hunting, a bunch of Southern stereotypes (...like Oklahoma, where these guys are supposed to be from, is so urbane!), █████████████, ██████████████████ (watch for him falling out of the pickup truck--NOT SURE IF THAT'S A SPOILER OR NOT?), ███████████ (of "The Outlaw Josey Wales" fame--my very favorite movie, by the way), plus ███████████ (pre-"NYPD Blue")! Oh, and █████████████...Big John's brother! Can you ask for a better cast in a "B" movie? I especially like the early scenes before they actually get to the camp site. The bbq/bar scene is especially good--I love to quote that one!. But, who forgets "brew" on a hunting trip..?
