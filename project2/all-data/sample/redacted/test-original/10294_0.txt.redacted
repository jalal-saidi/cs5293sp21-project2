Just finished watching this pre-Code movie called Night Nurse starring ████████████████ on VHS as one in several of a series of videocassettes named "Forbidden Hollywood" hosted by ██████████████. Before the picture starts ██████ tells of and shows many scenes that a few years after the year this film was made (1931) wouldn't have been allowed. Like scenes of Ms. ████████ and █████████████ undressing or of a bootlegger (████████) getting away with murder. ███████████, in one of his early roles, impresses greatly in his scenes with ███████ as the brutal chauffeur who's in cahoots with the crooked doctor in her hospital. And it's always a treat to see █████████████████ in another one of his kindly elderly paternal roles, here as ████████'s moral superior. And seeing ████████ and Lyon with the leading lady are such a treat that I'm now curious if they did anything else together. Quickly and efficiently helmed by ███████████████ who directed ████████████ to stardom in The Public Enemy the same year, Night Nurse is one of his more underrated gems.
