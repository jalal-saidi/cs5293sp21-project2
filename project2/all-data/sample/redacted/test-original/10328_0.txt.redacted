I am amazed at Ozon's insight into loss. When death is so sudden there can be the illusion of life continuing, particularly when a couple have grown together for so many years. We are led to see everything from █████'s point of view to the point that even her best friend, ██████, seems unsympathetic. When █████ does attempt to move away from ████'s memory, the new lover, after only one night, is already volunteering to help her with her "problem". The brief scene with mother-in-law is superb. The allusions to █████████████ are also key to understanding. <br /><br />For me, it is the sympathy given by Ozon to the character of █████, the one who has to cope with loss, which gives this film such power. Without a hint of indulgence, we see a strong character attempting to survive an experience which has shattered her life.
