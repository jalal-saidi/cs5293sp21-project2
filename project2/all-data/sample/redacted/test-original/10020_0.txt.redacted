During the late 1940s and early 1950s musicals acquired a distinctly noir-ish quality, and the life of singer ███████████ was made to order.<br /><br />Born in 1896, ██████ was a hardknocks chorus girl when she caught the eye of small-time Chicago hood Martin "Moe the Gimp" ██████, who married her in 1922 and proceeded to promote her career--occasionally, according to rumor, at gun point. By 1927 ██████ was a popular singer and a major Broadway star, and when talkies arrived the couple moved to California, where ██████ became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue. But the marriage was volatile, and when ██████ found ██████ was having an affair with pianist █████████████, ██████ shot him. Alderman survived and ██████ wasted little time in divorcing ██████ and marrying ████████, but the scandal was so shocking that it effectively ended her career. She died, largely forgotten, 1978.<br /><br />As you might expect, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME plays fast and loose with the facts, presenting ██████ as an innocent (she wasn't) and ██████ as a major crime figure (he wasn't); even so, it does seem to capture something elemental about both the era and the characters. Much of this is due to the on-screen chemistry between leads Doris Day and ████████████, who spark and sizzle in a truly surprising way.<br /><br />It will not surprise viewers that Cagney plays ██████ extremely well; he is, after all, best recalled for his numerous crime-drama roles. But it may surprise viewers that Day had the acting chops to match him. Today she is most widely remembered as a master of light comedy, but in truth Doris Day's films of the 1940s and 1950s were more often hard drama than fly-weight amusements, including such heavy-hitters as YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN, STORM WARNING, and YOUNG AT HEART; she would continue her string of dramatic roles in such films as ██████████████████ THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Her performance in LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is often considered her high-water mark as a dramatic actress: she gives it everything she's got, and the sparks really fly when she and Cagney square off.<br /><br />The look of the film, which was directed by █████████████ and sports art direction by the legendary ███████████████, is beautiful, and the film moves at a smart clip; its one failing is that censorship issues of the era left several scenes--including a legendary rape sequence--on the cutting room floor. The music, drawn from ██████'s most famous recordings, is also memorable, and Day pulls out all the stops for her songs. The DVD is not flawless, but you'll never notice it, and it includes several bonuses, two of which show us the real ███████████. Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
