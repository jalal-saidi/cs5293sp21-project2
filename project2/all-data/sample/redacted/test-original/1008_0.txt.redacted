A marvelous movie, from start to (just before the) finish.<br /><br />We meet █████████████████ and ███████████, with whom he has eloped recently, on shipboard. She is eager to start their home life together. All he can think of is seeing his mother.<br /><br />Louise ████████████ is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family. The other members, including █████████████ and █████████████████, are very good as well. Especially fine is █████████, as ██████████'s nephew. Indeed, he gives a heart-wrenching performance. It's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition.<br /><br />Montgomery is not only a mama's boy -- called █████ by everyone, as his name is ██████. He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel. Directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that █████ has lovingly worked on sculpting. He doesn't even notice it.<br /><br />It's very hard to fault this movie. The ending is a trifle disappointing. And a ██████████ aphorism is spoken by one character and laughed at by others, as if it were original to this screenplay.<br /><br />Hayes is superb and very likable. ██████████, not generally a favorite of mine, is believable as her self-centered husband. ████ is absolutely superb in a very touching role. And ████ is subtle but compelling as the woman of iron who becomes an invalid the minute doing so will get what she wants from her offspring.
