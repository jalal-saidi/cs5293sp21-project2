This tense 1931 melodrama stars a very young ████████████████ in the title role as █████████ assigned to take care of the two young daughters in a wealthy family. However, she uncovers a plot hatched by their alcoholic mother to kill the girls in order to steal their trust funds with the assistance of a nasty chauffeur and a corrupt doctor. Directed by ███████████████, the movie features several risqué moments with ████████ and pal █████████████ dressing and undressing in their uniforms, as well as moments of unexpected violence. Again, ███████████ shows up in a sinister role as the chauffeur and slaps ████████ around with convincing malevolence. While I prefer her work in 1933's "Baby Face" on Volume One, no one shined more than ████████ in these pre-code films since her non-nonsense manner was a perfect fit for the era's candor and directness.
