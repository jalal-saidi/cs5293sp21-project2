This movie has the quality that not even Hollywood films got its based on the truth that most people will not even want to see on your regular day drug abuse, depression, selfish parents, friendship, love ,lust and people like you and me. ██████ or ███ as he is called is a teenager from Buenos Aires, Argentina that overdosed himself with certain drugs for dogs then his father who lives in Spain comes worried to see him takes his son back to Spain (against his own will). the problem with Martin, H or Jay how he is called its that they don't get along at all except for █████ whom he is ██████'s father best friend (best actor ███████████████). █████ a homosexual who lives in a hotel talks to ██████ about every subject that not all friends will talk to one about(homosexuality, friendship, drugs, love, living up to be yourself). Then there's ████████████ who plays the role of ██████ the mistress of █████████ a classy performance on her part. I give this a 10 out of 10 right up there with NUEVE REYNAS.
