This is one gorgeous knockout of horror movie--beautifully directed by ████████ and acted by ██████████. The script is elaborate junk, but on imagery alone this ranks with ██████'s █████████ and ██████'s Vampyre as among the greatest horror movies ever made. Like those classics, the imagery is more entrancing than terrifying--I never wanted to hide my eyes. The last half-hour is just incredibly intense. Check out the way De Palma cuts from the Gothic night horror of ███████'s confrontation with his demon son to ████████████ cozy sunlit bedroom the next day. I always laugh out loud at this transition--because of course the director is just softening us up for the greatest horror climax in movies.
