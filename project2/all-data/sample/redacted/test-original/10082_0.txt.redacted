Totally generic, forgettable trash. Boring story and terrible animation (typical of █████████████). Not much different than the equally forgettable TV series, except with this they got "celebrity" voices. █████████████ should never have been hired to make a robot cartoon. There was a reason Transformers is remembered and loved and ██████ gone and forgotten-- the difference in quality of their respective television shows. Both were good toys, but Transformers had fun stories and great animation (for its time). ██████ was standard Saturday Morning schlock. I strongly suggest get the DVDs of "Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos" (currently out on Region 1) instead and see how the Gobots & Rock Lords should have been done.
