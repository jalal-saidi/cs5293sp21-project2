MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! I am from Durham, North Carolina where this took place. My family even knew ███████. I live a few blocks from the Cedar St home, and was shocked when I heard what happened. "Poor ███████.." I thought. What I was to learn about this man many of my family members and friends of my family called a friend would shock me. All things considered, I think the case is still extremely circumstantial, and the reasonable doubt is there. Can you move past the physical evidence and get into the science? I am not completely convinced as to his guilt OR his innocence, but I think the criminal justice system failed him. Was his bisexuality an issue? No. Was █████████████████ an issue according to the events of December 9th, 2001? Most certainly not. In the end, the trial wasn't even about ████████ anymore, but more so about trying to paint ███████ as sinister a man as there could possibly be.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great documentary, and I highly recommend this to everyone. ██████████ says this case is about pretenses and appearances, but look deeper into those, from both sides. Not even a Hollywood writer could make a script this compelling.<br /><br />10/10.
