A scary and good old-fashioned joy ride that concentraits on an aging goverment agent, ████████████ (████████████████Ben-Hur") who finds help from ███████ (██████████████Traffic"), a teenage girl who's surprised to learn that she has special abilities and he relies on her to find out where a crooked adversary of his, █████████ (the late ███████████████████The Dirty Dozen") is doing with his psychic son, █████ (███████████████████ /><br />Brian DePalma ("██████", "The Untouchables") directs here and he applies the hair-raising details where they're needed. ███████████ used his novel in adapting the screenplay. ██████████'s make-up and special effects are a delight to see and the ending is a good example of that. And legendary composer █████████████ serves up a tense and enjoyable musical score. The opening theme is the best one to listen to.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the performances are first-rate hands down. ███████ is reliable as he usually is, Cassavetes is up to his usual antics, and Irving shows here why she can looked upon to be a good actress.
