In some ways, ███████████ would seem like the only cast member who should be involved with the zany "Death Becomes Her", given that ████████████ is best known for serious roles and ████████████ is best known for action movies (not to mention that director ███████████████ is best known for the likes of "████████████"). But believe you me, everyone does a great job! Portraying two women vying for a man - and going to literally any length to succeed - this is one movie sure to blow your mind. Of course, the best part is what happens to ████ and ██████. How anyone came up with that I'll never figure out! And then they fight! Ha! Overall, this is just a really cool flick. Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else. Also starring are ██████████████████ as the woman who gives people the potion, and ██████████████ as a physician who gets a really, REALLY big surprise.<br /><br />I guess that you could say that ██████████████ character was "neck-in-neck" with certain other parties, and that █████████████ character had a hole in more places than her head!
