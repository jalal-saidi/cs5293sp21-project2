The marriage of a bickering couple in a fantasy-version of Las Vegas comes to a boil when the wife decides to leave (she wants a little excitement, but hubby is a homebody); both he and she link up with other partners, but will married-love win out? ████████████████ and █████████ star in this lavishly-designed, studio-shot concoction from director ████████████████████, who seemingly put all his heart into the unreality of the film's look and forgot to shape the characters (and involve the audience). There's nobody here worth giving a damn about, not ███████ nor ████, nor their new paramours, Latin smoothie ██████████ or pixieish showgirl ████████████████ (who has the film's best scene walking a tightrope, which may have been stolen from "King of Hearts"). The country music by █████████ and █████████████ hopes to work as a narrative theme, when actually a stronger screenplay might have sufficed. * from ****
