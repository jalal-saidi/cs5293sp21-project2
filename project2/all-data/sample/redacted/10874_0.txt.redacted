Before "Scanners" there was this wonderful little gore fest from ██████████████, who all-ready had done such great █████████-like thrillers as "Sisters" and "Obsession" and of course "██████", which in many ways is related to this one, another tale of telekinesis with deadly results. It is also worth noting that ██████████████████ above-mentioned "Scanners" seem to owe a great deal to this movie.<br /><br />"The Fury" balances brilliantly between weird and unexpected comedy (like the whole scene where ███████ carjacks two off-duty cops, one played by ████████████!) and imaginative horror that will turn off anyone who hates blood. Great acting from everyone; worth noting the star-making performances of ██████████ and ██████████████, ███████ who has a field-day, Cassavetes who looks great as the sinister bad-guy and ████████████████ who will touch your heart with her performance as the caring nurse ██████████ /><br />The last scene is quite a kick, truly one of the most memorable finales ever shown on screen, and it could very well leave you cheering well into the end credits!
