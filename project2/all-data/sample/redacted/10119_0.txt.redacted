This film plays out as a sort of western ███████ (1940. Rachel (Lorreta Young) lives in the shadow of Big Davy's (████████████████████ wife when she is 'bought' to keep house and educate the young son. The film essentially follows ██████'s efforts to gain acceptance and prove herself a worthy acquisition.<br /><br />Young is good in her role, adequately conveying ██████'s disappointment with married life and her relationships with two men, ██████ and Mitchum. Holden and ███████ in a sense both occupy the stranger tag of the title. Young marries ██████ as a stranger, and he remains a stranger even in marriage. ███████ is the stranger who appears and seems to offer ██████ a chance at salvation. Both men suit their roles. Holden, at first a grief-stricken widower, cold and unwelcoming, begins to open up to ██████ and appreciate her as a wife and companion, not a slave. ███████ sings and provides a lighter presence. █████████ gives strong support as the child who learns to love ██████ as a mother figure after his initial mistreatment of her.<br /><br />There are some interesting themes here, particularly the idea of female servitude. 'Rachel And The Stranger' poignantly questions the role of women in society and also the portrayal of women in western films. It looks at the gun myth in western films- guns allow ██████ to assert herself in a 'male' aspect. It hints at ██████'s dissatisfaction with the lack of sexual relations in her marriage. the Both central male figures are worth close analysis- ███████ claims to love and appreciate ██████ more than ██████'s character, yet he too only thinks of ██████ in monetary terms when he offers to 'buy' ██████ from Holden.<br /><br />'Rachel And The Stranger', in haunting black-and-white cinematography, is a real little gem of a film. It's simple, yet powerful themes and efficient running length mean that the film does not stray into long-winded sequences that detract from the original premise of ██████'s struggle as a 'replacement bride'.
