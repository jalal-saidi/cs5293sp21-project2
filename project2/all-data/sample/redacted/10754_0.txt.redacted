After the very good, wacky comedy 'Foul Play (1978)', two years later ███████████ and Chevy Chase would pair up again in this pleasant, light-headed farcical comedy 'Seems like Old Times'. Chase plays it dry and ████ is a loose pin, but it's the crackling chemistry between them that really works wonders and the third party of ██████████████ caps it off nicely. And not forgetting the ever reliable T.K Carter ('Southern Comfort', 'The Thing' and 'Runaway Train') who drops in with an amusing performance.<br /><br />Director ████████████ is responsible for a lot TV shows and TV movies, but his crack at a feature length film displays bounce with the comical bravura and timing. The witty script (magnificently penned by ██████████) is well placed with its gags that it never out stays its welcome, but maybe it gets lost amongst its laconic talky spots. The eventual kayos that occurs is rather structured in its episodic layouts that come and go, but it's done in a wry style than intentional clumsiness even throwing some slapstick moments aside.<br /><br />A highly entertaining comedy enterprise by two stars who were at their peaks.
