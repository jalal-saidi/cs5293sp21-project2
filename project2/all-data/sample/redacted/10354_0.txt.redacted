Another example of ███████████ making a poor script believable. More Catholic bashing and supernatural happenings. Unfortunately, the producers decided to kill off ████████████ early...an interesting character actor who could have added life to this otherwise dull film. At least ███ has a recurring television role to sustain her. Sigh.
