The young NIGHT NURSE watching two sick little girls finds herself pitted against a gang of heartless criminals.<br /><br />Barbara ████████ is a standout in this taut little film. Independent, resourceful and tough as nails, she pits herself against the bullying authority she encounters in the hospital and the absolute evil she must confront at the bizarre private home where she is sent to work. An intelligent & spirited actress, it was roles such as this which would hasten Stanwyck into becoming one of the biggest film stars of the 1930's.<br /><br />A fine cast gives ████████ ample support. ████████ plays the free spirited bootlegger who takes a shine to ███████. Brassy █████████████ portrays her worldly wise roommate. █████████████████ brightens his few scenes as a cherubic doctor, as does █████████████ as a flirtatious intern. ██████████ is properly implacable as the stern head nurse and Blanche Frederici adds a note of strangeness as a distraught housekeeper. Not yet a star, ███████████ is very effective as a menacing chauffeur.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize ███████████ as a Chinese patient & ████████████████ as the sick child who needs the milk bath--both uncredited.<br /><br />The Pre-Code status of the film is readily apparent. Stanwyck & Blondell are viewed in their lingerie as often as possible and ████████ must suffer some mighty rough handling from various villains in the movie. Capping it all off, ███████ exits the film with her new boyfriend, an unrepentant & unpunished crook involved in everything from thievery to murder, a situation certainly not allowed just a few years later.
