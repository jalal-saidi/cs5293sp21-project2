Aurora the housekeeper: Mrs. █████ the doggies ran away again. ██████ the lawyer: I'll just get six more tomorrow.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in the early 80's and fell in love with it immediately. This is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of the decade and I think it came out around the time of the equally hysterical and quotable Airplane, also a favorite.<br /><br />Goldie ████ is at her best as a lawyer with a heart of gold, ██████████████ is her husband ███ (█████, Hyram). Chevy Chase plays a writer who is ambushed into robbing a bank in Carmel California and winds up back in his ex-wife's life, needing her help to clear his name.<br /><br />As it has been said on IMDb, there are many wonderful quotes and the comedy is wound up and running like a second grade class full of ██████ Kisses. █████████████ is hysterical as the no nonsense housekeeper who has to get her feet scraped. ████████████ and ████████████████ of ██████ fame(forgive the spelling)have memorable cameos as well.<br /><br />I just finished watching it again after many years and it is still as funny as it was all those years ago. Also, Godspell fans, keep an eye out for █████████████ as a police officer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.
