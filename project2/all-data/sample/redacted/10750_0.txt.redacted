Amiable ██████████ farce about good-hearted defense attorney ████████████ (███████████), who's a sucker for hard luck cases and even incorrigible types. She's married to district attorney █████████ (██████████████), who's about to campaign for attorney general. Into their lives comes her ex-husband █████████████ (███████████), who just won't leave her alone. As the story begins, ████ is forced by two criminals to participate in a bank robbery and when they let him go (albeit while their vehicle is in motion), ████ figures ██████ - who he's never stopped loving - will be the only one willing to help him.<br /><br />Hawn, ██████, and Chase are all cast in parts perfect for each. (As a matter of fact, the entire film is cast well right down the line.) Chase gets to toss off his trademark wiseacre quips and even indulge in a little physical comedy. ████ is just as sweet as could be and Grodin is in fine grumpy form. And they're supported well by the other actors, including ████████████████ as ███████' colleague, ███████████████ as the governor, and ████████████ as the judge who has to watch as his courtroom turns into a circus. Particularly fun are █████████████ as harried maid ██████ and ███████████ as kleptomaniac turned chauffeur ███████████ /><br />The film itself marks a capable theatrical debut for ████████████, a man who honed his craft working on many TV series over the years. At one point, █████ remarks during the climactic trial how he loves it when time flies by. Well, time flies by watching this film as well. It's quite entertaining with not one dull moment. ██████' script is quite funny and spirited, with a dinner party rating as a real comedic highlight. It's all good-natured fun from its beginning to its end.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of the writer and the stars.<br /><br />8/10
