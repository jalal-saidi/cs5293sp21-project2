This movie is simply unwatchable. A word of advice for those who haven't seen "The Master of Disguise": for those of you - like me - who loved █████████████ impressions and comedy on SNL, remember him that way. I thought he was in the top 5 SNL cast members ever, and it was always a mystery to me why █████████████████████████ (fair-to-middling SNL alumni IMO) became stars while some of the true comedic geniuses like ████████████ and ███████████ didn't get top roles. In Mr. ██████'s case, the mistake of being in this film show that making good choices is of paramount importance to those aspiring to move on to the big screen. The movie is never funny and isn't even "bad" good. It just stinks. He plays a character named "Pistachio Disguisey". COME ON - my 5-year-old nephew could come up with a wittier name, and believe me, he wouldn't laugh at even the most infantile jokes in this flick. I defy any adult to even crack a smile. If you do, you must be on acid. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!
