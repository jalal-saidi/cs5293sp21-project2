████████████████ plays a night nurse at a very strange household where some children may be in serious danger.<br /><br />Strong pre-Code film has (for 1931) strong dialogue, ████████ and █████████████ in their underwear, alcoholism, nymphomania, attempted rape, child abuse and ███████████ (without his mustache) slugging ████████ unconscious.<br /><br />The plot is kind of silly but the film moves so quickly (72 minutes) that you sort of disregard it. There are also some nice directorial touches from ███████████████. The whole cast is great: ████████ is just superb in the title role--smart, strong and has no fear--she almost manages to stare █████ down in one of their fights. █████ is incredible as the bad guy--violent, brutal and very scary. There's great support from ████████ as ████████'s best friend and ████████ as a bootlegger with the hots for her.<br /><br ███ really great film--don't miss this one!<br /><br />Two of the many great lines: "I'm a nymphomaniac...and I'm proud of it!" "You MOTHER!"<br /><br />
