Does anyone remember the famous Star Trek episode, one of the earliest ones where an encounter with an anomaly in space leaves Enterprise crewman, █████████████ with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men? If you'll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another █████████████████ ████████████████████████████ has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. ███████ is being raised by his widowed father ████████████ who's a government agent. A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by ███████████████ to separate father from son. ███████ believes ███ has died, but ████ doesn't swallow that so easy.<br /><br />Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like ███████ with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon. ████████████████ and ███████████████ are working there as well. And so is ███████████ who's been given personal charge of ███████ and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.<br /><br />Brian ███████ directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from ██████████ as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner ████████████ before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective ███████████████. Franz plays a Chicago police officer who's something of a doofus. <br /><br />Fans of █████████████ in particular and horror films in general will very much like The Fury.
