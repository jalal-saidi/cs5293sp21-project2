This is an excellent Dark comedy that's very funny with 3 amazing performances from ████████████, ████████████ and ███████████!. All the characters are fantastic, and i thought the story was awesome, plus ████████████, ████████████ And ███████████ are all simply amazing in this!. █████ and ██████ seemed to be having a blast here, and It was great To see █████ ham it up in a different role and he pulled it off perfectly, plus the ending is hilarious!. ██████ and ████ had wonderful chemistry together, and the effects were really awesome, plus The plot was really cool as well!. Sure it's hammy but damn is it a lot of fun to watch, and it's extremely underrated as well, plus the costumes were fantastic!. █████ truly deserves her reputation as one of the best actresses of all time, and i thought the shovel duel was hilarious, plus the funeral scene at the end was very amusing.I can't believe this only has a 5.6 rating as it should be much higher in my opinion, plus ██████ and █████'s constant arguing was quite funny. This is is an excellent dark comedy, that's very funny, with 3 amazing performances from Willis, ██████ and ████, and i say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is great!. ███████████████ does a great job here, with awesome camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is amazing!. ████████████ is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, had a ball watching him Ham it up as a surgeon, had some very funny dialog, had awesome chemistry with ██████ and ████, looked very funny in those glasses, and just did an amazing job overall, a tough role that he nailed perfectly. (Willis Rules!!!). ████████████ is also AMAZING here, she is extremely hilarious, gorgeous, seemed to be having a ball, had some great costumes, was very unpredictable and i just loved her overall, she was amazing. (██████ Rules!!!). ███████████ is also amazing here, she is very beautiful, funny, had some cool facial reactions, was quite bizarre at times, and just rocked overall!.
