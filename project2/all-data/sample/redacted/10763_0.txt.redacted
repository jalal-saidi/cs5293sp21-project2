Decided to view this film simple because of the title and I was probably thinking about ██████████ and his many faces of Horror. Well, this film was a horrible mess and a big Horror to watch. I will have to say that ████ Carvey,(Pistachio █████████████████████████ did a great job of acting crazy and I am sure it was not easy to follow the script. ███████████████████████████ Baker),"Crash",'04, was rather cute and very attractive and gave a good supporting role. Last but not least, █████ Brolin,(Fabbrizio Disguisey),"A Guy Thing",'03, added his talents to this picture, but I began to wonder if ████████████████ enjoyed this film and her husband's performance. WOW
