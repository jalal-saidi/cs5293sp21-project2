I started watching the show out of curiosity and I ended up a fanatic. Great script, great performances, superb directing. The show is a advertisement for both Turkey and Greece. I Give 9/10 and not straight 10 because of the poor Greek Language the actors speak. We had a similar show here in Greece but ours was a drama (with no reason). ███████ damat changes the spectator's mood. █████ is unbelievably beautiful and █████ despite the fact that he is a rookie ████████████████ of reality game "Turkiye Academy"????) is doing pretty good. Gongratulations!<br /><br />Rcpjimmy, ███████████████, Greece<br /><br />P.S. Great soundtrack too!
