It's a cinematic tradition: the handsome young man who insinuates himself into a household of boring bourgeois types and stirs things up. █████████████ did it in ███████, ██████████████ in Reflections in a Golden Eye, █████████████ in Entertaining Mr. ██████, ██████████ in Six Degrees of Separation. Here, the young man is a bisexual who quickly wins the heart of a frustrated Miou-Miou and disturbs the dull, penny-pinching boss of a dry cleaners, Berling. The script and direction by █████████████ are assured, but the ending is absurd, something that feels tacked-on.<br /><br />Stanislas Merhar deserved the Most Promising Actor █████ that he won as the pretty boy; you can readily see why the wife can't get enough of his caresses. ███████████████ often plays men who suffer in silence, and here he's good as the husband.
