This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, █████████████ as █████████████. █████ has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by ██████████████. Other cast include a younger and thinner ████████████████ of Without A Trace fame, ██████████████ who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by █████████████████. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular ███." Another good film directed by █████████████ is "████████████.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, █████████. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "████████████.". So enjoy!
