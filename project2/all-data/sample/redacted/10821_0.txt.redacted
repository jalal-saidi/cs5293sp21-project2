In Cameron, a group of hunters is attacked by a wild animal, and ██████████████ (█████████████████) survives but sees his brother █████ (████████████) dying. Seven years later, his teenage nephew ████████████ (███████████) steals the key of his stepfather's cabin in the isolated Fire Road 13 and travels with four classmates and his friend ███ (█████████████████) to spend the weekend having a party with booze and sex. However, they are attacked by a Beast that kills his friends in a sadistic way. ███ and █████ survive, and they suspect that his stepfather ███████████████ (█████████████) is a werewolf. When ███████ meets █████ and ███, they decide to collect evidence to prove that ████████ is the Beast and kill him, but ████████ discovers their plot and chases the trio.<br /><br />"Big Bad Wolf" is a surprisingly good werewolf movie, with gore and black humor. The beginning with teenagers going to an isolated cabin and finding a monster is not original, but the sadistic attack of the werewolf, specially the virgin girl, is hilarious. The situation of ███ collecting DNA sample is also funny. The special effects are great for a B-movie and in the end "Big Bad Wolf" is a very entertaining movie and recommended for fans of the genre. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
