It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not ████████████ was familiar with ███████████ sixties play Entertaining Mister ██████ (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing █████████ a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist. █████'s protagonist disrupted a home occupied by a brother and sister both childless whilst ████████'s shares a home with a married couple who have a child. There are, of course, other substantial differences, where █████████ came, as it were, out of nowhere, ████ (████████████████) is first encountered by ██████ (Miou-Miou) and ██████████ (███████████████) ████████ in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister ███████ (████████████████████ only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when ███████ leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend. The █████████ have been married for some fifteen years and it may be said that the marriage has become as 'dry' as the dry cleaning business they own and is in need of sexual 'cleaning'. If so they came to the right place for the amoral ████ is happy to oblige, first by seducing ██████ - not terribly difficult as she was ripe for seduction - and then, with less success, ██████████. What we have here is a fine, tightly written and directed script acted to perfection by the three principals and arguably the finest of Fontaines early films - Berning would later appear in her How I Killed My Father. Very definitely worth seeing.
