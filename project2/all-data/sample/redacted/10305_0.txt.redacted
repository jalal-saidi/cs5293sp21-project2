████████████████ as █████████ is having a little trouble getting a job as a nurse in a big hospital. Seems she needs a high school diploma. That's no problem for ████, she just shows middle-aged Dr. ████ (█████████████████) a little leg and a big smile, and everything is set. She soon becomes chums with another girl with some nice legs of her own, ███████, played by █████████████. The girls are in nursing school in the hospital, though it looks more like reform school. Be in bed by 10 p.m., no boy friends allowed, and work, work, work. The pace is fast and the interns are hot on the make, but ████ falls for a bootlegger when he shows up for treatment with a bullet in his arm. No problem, we just won't mention that on the medical report. The girls get an outside assignment taking care of some little girls who are slowly being starved to death for insurance money by "Nick", (███████████!) ████ stands up to ████ as only ████████████████ can when she's steaming mad. No problem for ████, though, he clocks her a couple of times, (the camera cuts discreetly when ████ takes it on the chin) and down she goes. There's a chiseling doctor Dr. ██████ in on the scheme, a real low-life type wonderfully played by ████████████, whoever he is. But have no fear, ████ and ███████ will set things right somehow. This outrageous film is highly recommended. A must for ████████ and ████████ fans.
