The former orphan █████ (█████ Rueda) raises her adopted son █████ (█████████████) with her husband ██████ (█████████████) in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. █████ is HIV positive and tells █████ that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. █████ decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend █████. The busy █████ does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and █████ vanishes. █████ feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate █████ invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.<br /><br />"El Orfanato" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot). My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Orfanato" ("The Orphanage")
