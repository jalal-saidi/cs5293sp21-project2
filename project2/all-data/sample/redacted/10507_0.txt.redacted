If you have an ████ fan in your house, and was disappointed to only see him one scene (not speaking) role in 1985's movie Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird, well your little one will not be disappointed. The first movie with the Sesame Street friends for the first time in 14 years. Long time isn't it. As the movie opens, ████ (███████████) and his freind ███ (██████████) has a tug of war on ████'s blanket ripping, ████ gets mad at Zoe, and then it winds up in █████'s (██████████████) trash can, ████ jumps into the trash can, and he and his blanked wind up in Grouchland. (Spoiler Warning) And the movie's villian (██████████████) steals ████'s blanket. (Spoiler Warning #2) Every so often, ████ (████████) yells "Stop the Film". (Spoiler Warning #3) When ████'s Sesame Street pals learn that ████ has jumped into █████'s trash can, some of them, Big Bird, etc jumped in after him. (Spoiler Warning #4) While ████ makes his way up a mountain to the villian's house. If you ever wondered what does goes on inside █████'s can, this the movie for you to see. ███████████████████ appears as the Queen of Trash. Note like the earlier Sesame Street movie this is a rare live movie to get a G rating from the MPAA. And if parents don't want thier kids to hear bad language, this is a must watch along with the first movie. So what are you waiting for, rent or buy this movie today, you will be glad you did. Parents will be happy not have to view a movie with kids, but may want to. What would have made this even better if ████ didn't yell "Stop the Film". 10/10
