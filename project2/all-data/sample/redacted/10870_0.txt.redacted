After the success of ██████ (1976), ██████████████ followed up with another outstanding film about youths with incredible telepathic powers.<br /><br />Government agent's telepathic son is kidnapped and along with a similarly-gifted teenage girl he seeks to save him.<br /><br />Based upon the novel by ███████████, The Fury is a film that could have easily became a mundane action film if not for the splendid direction of De Palma and an outstanding cast. ████████ once again shows his excellent directorial style and his technique for grand suspense. The Fury has some great action sequences, a tremendous climax, and one outrageous conclusion! Makeup FX artist ██████████ lends his talents to create some good blood-letting, especially for that knock-out closing image. █████████████ also deserves special mention for his wonderfully powerful music score.<br /><br />Star ████████████ is great as the government agent searching for his son. ███████████████ is good as the films cold villain. ██████████ and ██████████████ are both sympathetic as youths attempting to live with their amazing mental powers. Supporting cast Snodgress, Durning, and █████ are also good.<br /><br />All around The Fury is a pretty under appreciated thriller that firmly ranks among the best of De Palma's films.<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****
