Have not seen this film in years and just recently enjoyed viewing it once again. I always enjoy the acting of █████████████ who played (██████████████████████████████, who is an American working in NY on skycrapers and very successful and is drawn into the past horrors of Nazi rule in Europe. ████ gets involved very deeply with ███████████████████████ Tennyson),"Strangers Kiss,",83, and falls in love with her sexy charms. They both run through the "RED LIGHT" district in Europe through a carnival of FREAKS, which keeps the audience wondering just where this film is going to lead us and will ████ eventually obtain the BILLIONS of Dollars he is responsible to handle? Enjoyed the last and great acting of ████████████████████████████████████████████████, who was formerly married to the late ████████████, "My Fair Lady", fame on Broadway. █████ gave an outstanding performance, however, ████████████ will be greatly remembered for her long career in making outstanding Classic films. This film will keep your interest right to the very end, sit back and enjoy every moment, which keeps you on the very edge of your seat.
