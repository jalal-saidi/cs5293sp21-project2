Mortadelo & Filemon's first film (and may be not the last because it's going to be a success) is just great. Transforming the comic into a movie was a really hard job, but █████████████ has accomplished it very well; the comic's gags, humour and constant violence is here, helped by convincing and hilarious special effects (there are many!); it's a mix between ██████'s humour (shown in El Milagro de P. Tinto) and ████████████████ one.<br /><br />The comics are quite known, specially around Europe, and of course, in Spain. However, whether you know them or not, it doesn't matter because its fun for everyone, all ages! The movie isn't based in any of the comics, but takes several elements from their first long comic, ██████████████████ (1968), but there are many other references. █████████████ and ████████████ are excellent in their parts; Pocino doesn't perform. He IS █████████. And he does his job fairly well. Viyuela isn't as similar as the comic's Filemon but has the exact psycology, and I think he does the best performance in the film. The other supporting actors, like █████████████ (as Prof. ████████) and ███████████████ (as the Superintendent), are almost identic, and you do really believe that it's the comic translated to the screen. ███████████████ plays ███████████, an invented character, hilariously.<br /><br />There are other funny characters like ███████████ and the people in 13 Rue del Percebe, that have great cameos in this film. It is, as ████████████████ (the creator of the comic) said, the comic as a movie. It's really imaginative, with many original ideas and things (like Prof. ████████'s cool inventions)<br /><br />Finally, must say that the special effects are simply amazing, and really believale (they don't look cheesy or fake), the best in spanish movies, and there are so many details that it's impossible to see them all if you see it only once; there are lots of gags and funny details that you won't notice at first sight, so look sharp!<br /><br />Very entertaining movie, you laugh your pants off ***1/2 of ****
