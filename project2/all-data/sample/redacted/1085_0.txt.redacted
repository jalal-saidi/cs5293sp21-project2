This is a funny ███████████ film, that's great fun to watch,with some awesome stunts, and two knockout performances from ███████████!. All the characters are cool, and the story is very entertaining, plus ███████████ is simply amazing in this!. I really liked the opening in black and white when they showed the twins as kids, and I loved the reference to ████████ and The Rocky movies with Tammy's(Nina ██████) boyfriend █████, plus it has some pretty good fights in it too. I actually found this to be more of a Comedy, but that's OK because it was highly enjoyable, and I think this should be higher then 6.0, plus the ending is absolutely hilarious!. As always ██████ does some amazing stunts, and the scene where ██████ and Tyson(Teddy ██████████) escape on the boat is pretty exciting, plus while some of the humor is incredibly silly I couldn't help but laugh at it. The scene where ██████ plays at the Orchestra and does █████████ work is a scream, plus the fight at the car wash is also hilarious! (since the brother ███████ can't fight). This is a funny ███████████ film, that's great fun to watch, with some awesome stunts, and two knockout performances from ███████████, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. █████████ and █████████ do a great! job here with very good camera work, good angles and just keeping the film funny and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. ███████████ is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, extremely likable as both ██████ and ██████, had great chemistry with both █████████████ and ███████████, kicked that ass, and was absolutely charming! (Jackie Rules!!!!!!!). █████████████ is gorgeous and does fine as Boomer's(well technically) love interest, she was likable and did a great job I really liked her. ████████████████ is funny as ██████'s best friend █████, he was likable and added a lot of laughs I dug him. ███████████ is beautiful, and also did fine as █████████ love interest (well technically), I really liked her. █████████████ is good as the villain and was menacing. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5
