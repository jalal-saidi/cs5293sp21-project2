What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said, so how 'bout some background information. If you're up on your Hollywood History, you know that many stars who were chosen for a film were replaced for certain reasons, but if █████████████ had not been under suspension at Warners, he would have played ██████████ instead of ███████████. ████████████████ originally wanted █████████████ for her version of A Star Is Born and he would have been great and the film would have been a lot better, but the Colonel wouldn't have it. ████████████ originally wanted ██████████ for A Star Is Born and personally, I think he would have far better in the role of ███████████. After ████████████ was fired from Annie Get Your Gun, the first person that they wanted to play █████ was █████████████, but because of her an-gent she lost out having the role of a lifetime in the movies, and after this happened, ████████████ wanted to play █████ in the worst way, but 20th Century wouldn't lend her out, so finally after seeing ████████████ in The Perils of Pauline, she was hired to play █████. Originally, ██████████████ was the not the first choice for Breakfast at Tiffany's, instead they wanted █████████████, and she would have been great, but her schedule wouldn't allow, and many others lost out to roles like these did. So, what does this have to do with Love Me Or Leave Me. In ██████████████████████████ she said that she was offered the part of ███████████ but had a choice between that project and another and her an-gent kept telling her, "Do Love Me Or Leave Me", but in the long run Doris Day was given the role. Personally, I can see ████████████ playing ███████████ to the hilt. She would have been great. She would have matched █████ scene for scene and been up to Cagney and his scene stealing, and she could have sung those songs, but, alas, █████████ got the role and in the long run set her up at Metro for many years into the future! We're very proud of our ████████████████, Price Hill girl, from here in Cincinnati, Ohio!
