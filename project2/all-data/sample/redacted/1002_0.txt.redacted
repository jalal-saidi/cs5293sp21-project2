Before seeing this movie, i did expect it to be a no budget "so bad its good" zombie flick. What i saw was a lot worse. First of all ████████████ has a very dull script - Lord Zombie (█████████████) is creating human-like zombies and sends them to Earth. This is just pathetic. I don't understand why in hell did people like ██████████, ██████████, ██████████████, ████████████, ██████████████, ████████████ and ███████████ even appear in this movie. ██████████ plays God. ██████████ plays Jesus Crist. ████████████ appears for only 5 mins, and even makes fun of his own cult movie The Maniac Cop !<br /><br />The effects are cheap, and unrealistic. Awful soundtrack. The directing is even worse. Zombie make-up is none-existent. Some zombies are kickboxers, and kung-fu fighters. The acting is beyond bad. In the beginning of the movie, director ████████ tells us not to watch this movie, because its bad. Well after seeing ████████████ i'll have to admit, he was right. His House of the Dead was better than this. <br /><br />So, to sum it up - don't watch this movie. Its really that bad. And believe me, i've seen bad movies. This one is worse than Zombie Lake, Flesheaters, Bloodeaters, Meat Market, Redneck Zombies, Bone Sickness...etc. All of the B-movie stars listed above appear for only a couple of minutes each. Other actors are absolutely awful. The movie isn't funny, isn't scary, isn't interesting, isn't shocking. The only movie i can think of right now, that is worse than ████████████ is probably Zombiez. 1/10
