██████████, ██████████, ████████████████, ██████████, ███████████, ██████████ and a 7 foot tall black teenager named ████████████ in the most Jewish movie ever made. As I watched this on Fox Movie Channel earlier tonight I wasn't laughing -- because my mouth was hanging open too wide. Where to begin? Where?!? This movie has the highest per capita amount of asthma jokes I've ever seen. Just when you think there are no more laughs to get out of an asthma joke -- there's another! And all ██████ wants is to visit her sister in Florida (pronounced Flaaaaahrida.) Need I mention that the patriarch of the family is in the garment business? And he has a sign on his door for his son to read which says "Keep Out Putz?" Need I mention that everyone talks down to the Spanish speaking men painting the house? Need I mention that ██████ won't allow her husband to attend such an occasion in a sports jacket and slacks? Need I mention that ██████████ refers to the refrigerator as "the icebox?" Oh. . .oh, I'm starting to palpitate. This film is unavailable on DVD or VHS, but Fox Movie Network is pretty good about rerunning things. If they show it again, I am taping it.
