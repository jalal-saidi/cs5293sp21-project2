█████████████ is a rare director, one who takes a simple story, places it in the eyes and bodies of his cast, and simply lets the tale tell itself. SOUS LE SABLE (UNDER THE SAND) is an unforgettable film experience that probes deeply into our psyches, hearts, and reason: how do we cope with sudden death? Opening quietly in the French countryside, a loving middle-aged couple begins a brief vacation in a family house, quietly and lovingly going about removing dustcovers, opening shuttered windows - settling in for a time of being alone together. █████ (██████████████████) is a professor of English in Paris (her specialty is ██████████████) and ████ (████████████) is her retired husband. Their long-term love is palpable: ████ provides almost no dialogue, as none is needed to establish this special relationship, so powerful is the non-verbal communication between ████████ and ██████. They visit the beach the next day and while █████ is sunbathing, ████ goes for a swim - and never returns. █████ searches for him, engages lifeguards, and ultimately returns to Paris, trembling but intact. Months later, while ████ is never found, we see █████ reacting as though he still exists. She visualizes him in various situations and the two actors (yes, ████ is present in these scenes) interact as though nothing has changed. But █████'s friends note with great concern that she is 'delusional' and make various attempts for her to seek professional and emotional help. When news eventually arrives that ████'s body has been found, she internally denies this possibility but eventually returns to the vacation house town to identify the bloated corpse. Even at this point, though obviously in shock, she denies that the corpse is that of her beloved ████. She walks back to the site where she last saw ████ and in the distance a figure rekindles her hope...<br /><br />Charlotte ████████ delivers a performance wholly committed. She communicates the spectrum of feelings of this challenged strong woman with her eyes, her gazes in the mirror, her interaction with her class of students, her friends, her admirer with such power that makes her █████ a wholly credible creature stricken by loss yet surviving in her chosen manner. It is one of the great performances of cinema. The entire small cast of this film is perfection. ████ is a magical director and continues to prove he is one of the most honest and quietly powerful figures in today's cinema. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Grady Harp
