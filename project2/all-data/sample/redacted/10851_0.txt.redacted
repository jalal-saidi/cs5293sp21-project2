"The Fury" has gotten better with age and can now be viewed as one of ███████'s most satisfying thrillers. It consists of two stories which eventually overlap. The first story deals with a former government agent (████████████) who searches for his son, who has been kidnapped by the feds who want to exploit his telekinetic powers. The second story revolves around a teenaged girl (██████████) who discovers that she too has paranormal powers. Eventually, ███████ enlists her aid in finding his son. The film includes some unexpected humor and several breathtaking sequences, to include a stunning shot where ██████'s character is surrounded by past images of ███████' son (you gotta see it to believe it). The denouement is contrived, but effective and has been ripped by other films.
