I must have seen this film about 15 or so times now. I love the vain, shallow characters of ████████ and █████ who are the ultimate example of what might happen if you took the advice of our "obsessed-with-perfection" media to its illogical conclusion. █████ and ██████ play their parts with unrestrained enthusiasm, pushing them to the limit to emphasise that these two who believe they are truly beautiful are, after all, just caricatures of perfection. <br /><br />Like Icarus, Mad and Hell take no advice and pursue the unattainable regardless of the cost. That they see every mountainous obstacle as a mere minor inconvenience helps reinforce the humour of the film. ████████████ is marvellous as ██████, the unhappy mouse caught in the middle of their game; the voice of reason amid lunacy.<br /><br />The writing is witty and sometimes painfully sharp, emphasising in almost every scene that beauty does not equal happiness, and the closer you come to attaining an obsessively pursued physical perfection, the further you get from real happiness and fulfillment. Stylistically our attention is focused on this concept over and over again, with mirrors and reflections used very creatively throughout the film.<br /><br />We don't see a lot of clever satire these days, which is a pity. This is a fabulous film.
