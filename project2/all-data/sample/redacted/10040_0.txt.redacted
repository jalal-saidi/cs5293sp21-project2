It looks like this movie has had quite mixed reviews, but personally<br /><br />I love it! It's outrageous, irreverent and absolutely hilarious. The<br /><br />special effects are amazing and the gags just keep coming.<br /><br />There are so many witty lines that it's hard to remember them all.<br /><br />One of my favourites is when ████████████ and ███████████ plan<br /><br />to murder ████████████ (who plays ██████' wife). They concoct an<br /><br />elaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis ends<br /><br />up pushing her down the stairs instead. After the deed is done he<br /><br />phones ███████████ and breathlessly exclaims, "█████? I did it!<br /><br />She's dead, she started shouting at me and I couldn't take it any<br /><br />more and I pushed her down the stairs and she's dead!" There is<br /><br ███ long pause on the other end of the phone, then ████ slowly<br /><br />asks , ". . . which part of the plan didn't you understand?".<br /><br />Meanwhile, ██████ is not dead, but is slowly standing up at the foot<br /><br />of the stairs with her head on backwards!<br /><br />Isabella █████████ is good as the mysterious ████████████████<br /><br />and, at times, looks and sounds uncannily like her mother, ██████<br /><br />Bergman. The film is not everyone's cup of tea, I know, but it's a scream!
