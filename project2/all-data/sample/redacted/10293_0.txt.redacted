What other movie has a bootlegger as a likable hero. Where the phrase "my boys just took him for a ride" can give you a happy feeling. What movie but "Night Nurse" - an addictively weird movie. ████████████████ gives a typical top rate performance. ███████████ plays a psychotic chauffeur. The studio may have been testing him in different roles because the same year he was in "The Easiest Way" playing the decent, hard- working and quite moralistic husband of ██████████ - an even more "blink and you will miss him" role. █████████████ is always great - this time as ████████'s pal. ████████████ as the oddball doctor with some strange tics and even stranger habits - the film seemed to leave it up to you to figure him out and it was not hard. ████████████████ who was so powerful in "These Three" plays ██████, one of the little children in the midst of the intrigue. You will go back for a second and third look at "Night Nurse". "sez who" "sez me in a big way sister".
