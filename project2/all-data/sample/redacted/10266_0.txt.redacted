They don't make films like this anymore! This is one of the pioneer reality films. originally, the studio wanted to market █████████████ as a replacement for ██████████, a teen idol thing. But he turned out to be so much more,the innovator of real TV and docudrama. This film takes you with him on his travels around the country as he competes (motorcycle). They throw in an interesting, non cheesecake girl, ██████████████ and the song "Wayfarin' Stranger" and the sojourn continues. People who like this film should see ███████ in "Wild Seed", a train hopping adventure which features █████████████ and ██████████. The movie "Then Came ███████" later landed █████ a popular TV show of the same name in the 60's.
