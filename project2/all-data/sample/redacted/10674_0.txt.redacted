In a small town in France, ███████████████ (Miou-Miou) and her husband ███████████████████ is a traditional French middle-class couple, bored with their years of marriage and running a small business of cleaning and ironing clothes with some financial difficulties. When they meet the bisexual ████ (████████████████) working as drag in a night-club with his sister ███████ (████████████████), the sexually dissatisfied ██████ feels a great sexual attraction for him. The couple brings the young man to live and work with them, in a weird relationship, and ██████ has an affair with ████ and becomes a happy person. This intriguing triangle of love has a tragic end. "███████████████" is almost an excellent romance. The screenplay begins very daring, but the solution for the love situation is very moralist and resolved in a tragic, but easy way. The cast has a great performance and the direction is very good, but the story deserved a better conclusion. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Lavagem a Seco" ("Dry Cleaning")
