i enjoyed ███████████████████ paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.███████████ wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.***possible minor spoiler ahead***like many people i thought ██████████████ came out 3 years later) was revolutionary.but the Fury paved the way for that film.(and yes,The Fury borrows form ██████,another DePalma film.in fact some of the sequences in Scanners were nearly identical to those in the Fury,but were actually not as graphic.i think The Fury is actually a superior film.██████████ is terrific,and steals the show.the supporting cast is also good,with ████████████,████████████████,███████████████,██████████████,and ███████████.███████████████ also has a small role.an unrecognizable ████████████████████████████████ from the long running soap The Young and the Restless)also has what amounts to a cameo.but it's ████████████ in his very brief appearance that is hysterical in a bit of comic relief performance.as for the movie itself,if you have a weak stomach or don't like horror films,i suggest you avoids this.but if you like being scared,pop this in late at night for maximum effect.my vote for The Fury is a 9/10 P.S. some people may find this movie slow by today's standards,but that merely builds up the suspense and is well worth sitting through.
