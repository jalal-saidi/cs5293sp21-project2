███████████████ follow up to his popular "██████", was in many aspects a continuation of the mood he had already established in his former work. Thus, "The Fury" suffered because it was not an inspired choice for a man who knew better, but for whatever circumstances decided to go ahead with this project. The film is based on a novel by ███████████, which we never read, so there is no point of reference. Mr. ██████ also wrote the screen treatment.<br /><br />This ambitious film travels from the Middle East to Chicago in a tale of intrigue and super natural forces that is incomprehensible, at times. The idea of having a gifted young man working for the bad guys and capitalizing on all that can be extracted from his prodigious mind, is a disturbing idea. That there could be another brilliant mind, a young woman, presents a challenge for the evil people that are trying to use them for evil purposes.<br /><br />The director was not as lucky with "The Fury" as with some of his best known, and more accomplished films. ██████████ plays the young ███████, who is terrified once she understands why she is so much wanted. In a way, she is an extension of ██████, the heroine of the previous film. ████████████ has some good moments. ████████████████ was one of the best things in the movie. ███████████████, ████████████, and ███████████, do outstanding work. On the other hand, the great actor/director ███████████████ seems to sleep walk through his role as the man behind the conspiracy. █████████████ is seen briefly in the scene at ███████'s school.<br /><br />The film has an effective musical score from █████████████. Although the director didn't succeed in making this a better movie, he still shows an affinity for the genre and cannot be dismissed for trying to create a good entertainment.
