Curiously enough after I viewed my VHS copy of Love Me or Leave Me, I went to the movies and saw Walk the Line. One of the things that struck me was that while ███████████████ had a much tougher job because ███████████ was performing almost up to the end and had a distinctive sound that I didn't think anyone could match, Phoenix did a very good job in capturing him.<br /><br />On the other hand ███████████ had not been seen in films for over 20 years, nor had she made a record in that length of time either. She was living very quietly in retirement. So except with older members of the public, Doris Day did not have to compete with an image people had in their minds.<br /><br />Also people left out of this story include ███████████████ first wife and his daughter from that marriage. Also the fact that ██████ was Jewish. My guess is that MGM did not want a false issue of anti-Semitism raised.<br /><br />There sure were enough issues anyway. ███████████, a girl from the sticks with lots of singing talent, is determined to succeed. So she latches on to a small time Chicago hood named █████████████ who gets her career started and in gear.<br /><br />I remember reading that in her life with ██████, ██████ found it impossible to socialize due to ██████'s boorish behavior. One of the few other show business personalities that she did socialize with was her co-star in Kid Boots on Broadway, ████████████. Cantor who was brought up on the Lower East Side of New York, lived with guys like ██████ in his youth so he was used to it and put up with him. Very few others would.<br /><br />Incidentally the title tune Love Me or Leave Me comes from the score of Kid Boots.<br /><br />In Love Me or Leave Me, we don't have █████ doing an imitation of ███████████, we have █████ singing like █████ which is just fine for me. She sings the songs that were identified with ██████ very well. The album for this film sold very well for her.<br /><br />James Cagney made his third and final trip to the Oscar Derby with his portrayal of ██████ "the gimp" Snyder. In its way ██████ is as complex a role as ██████'s ████████████. He's an uneducated kid from the slums who made it in the rackets, but feels terribly inferior around all the show business creative types that his wife now by necessity has to associate with, where ironically due to his drive has pushed her there. Cagney lost the █████ race to ███████████████ for █████. Ain't that a piece of irony itself.<br /><br />Cameron ████████ as ███████████████ (real first name Myrl) does very well as the man who eventually became her second husband as does the rest of the cast.<br /><br />All three of the people that Day, Cagney, and ████████ portray were still alive at the time that Love Me or Leave me was being filmed. All signed off on the picture, I assume all parties were satisfied with it. <br /><br />And so should you.
