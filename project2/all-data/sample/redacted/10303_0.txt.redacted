One of ██████████████████ best early starring films is Night Nurse which essentially is two separate stories.<br /><br />The first is young ███████ in training to be a nurse and teaming up with █████████████, another would be nurse, in a typical █████████████ role. Stanwyck is a bit more dedicated to the profession, but she learns from ████████ how to take a more realistic attitude.<br /><br />The second part of the film concerns ████████ being assigned as a private night nurse to some kids who are being slowly starved to death. Something is really wrong when you see malnourished kids in a purportedly wealthy home. ████████ suspects something amiss and she's quite right. The doctor ████████████ and the chauffeur ███████████ are in cahoots in a murderous scheme.<br /><br />Stanwyck puts her own career on the line to bring some justice and compassion to her charges. In doing so she has to step on some medical toes and question the ethics of who she's working for.<br /><br />Clark █████ was loaned out from MGM to play the murderous chauffeur and if he hadn't been discovered as a new kind of tough leading man, he would have had a grand career as a character actor playing all kinds of thugs who slug. And slug ████████ he does, right on the kisser.<br /><br />Stanwyck gets some help from breezy bootlegger ████████ who would soon be leaving for the UK with his wife ████████████ where he would have his best success. Earlier in the film ████████ kind of winks at the rules where Lyon is concerned and she makes a friend who comes in real handy when dealing with █████ and Harolde.<br /><br />Lyon is fine, but this seemed to be a part ████████████ would have been perfect for. And Cagney going up against █████ would really have made this a classic.
