Wimpy ████████████ (the likable ███████████), his scrappy tomboy best friend █████████████████████ (an appealingly spunky performance by █████████████████), and four of █████'s obnoxious college classmates go to a remote cabin in the woods owned by █████'s stepfather to party hearty. Things go sour when a vicious werewolf shows up and kills everyone except for █████ and ███. █████ suspects that the werewolf is really his mean, jerky, abusive step dad ██████████████ (excellently played to the sneering hateful hilt by █████████████). █████, ███, and █████'s uncle ██████ (the solid █████████████████) all join forces to try to figure out a way to stop Toblat before he kills again. Writer/director ████████████████ offers a fresh and novel spin on the standard werewolf premise by cleverly blending the more horrific elements with a surprisingly potent and touching domestic drama. The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (███ in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to █████'s winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace. Popping up in nice cameos are ████████████ as grubby hick █████████████ and ██████████████ as friendly Sheriff █████████. The nasty, hulking, wisecracking werewolf makes for a ferocious and frightening monster: the savage beast rips off heads, tears people to pieces, rapes women, and even brutally castrates one poor guy (ouch!). █████████ spooky'n'shuddery score, ██████████████████ bright, polished cinematography, and the funky special effects are all uniformly up to par. Moreover, we even get plenty of unflinchingly graphic gore, a pleasing amount of tasty female nudity, a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black twisted humor, and even some soft-core sex. A nifty little sleeper.
