One of my █████████████ /><br />The film is about ██████████ (███████) who works at a huge Megaplex, where things begin to go wrong. His siblings (Smith)(Wachs) are two movie lovers, like myself, who want to save the Megaplex. If that isn't enough, the place is about to have a huge premiere for the owners film. Crazy huh? Anyway, the acting is pretty decent, some fiction mixed in with Non-Fiction. It's got to be one of the best and most remembered Disney Film.<br /><br />Micky ██████ is in it! How much better can it get! One for the family, this film. It's entertainment on all levels.<br /><br />Disney better continue to play this film, because if they don't, I have no idea whats going on in their heads.
