Following in the vein of shows such as The Mighty Boosh, ████████████████ Darkplace is a show that clubs to death the genre of hospital drama with the Dean Learner's wooden acting.<br /><br />Each of the actors play two sets of characters. ███████████████ plays horror novelist ██████████████ who penned a horror show called "████████████████ Darkplace" which was cancelled in the '80s but resurrected in the modern day. ████████ plays the show's hero, the doctor with a tragic past, ████████████. ██████████████ plays the show's producer ████████████, and the stereotypical "boss" █████████████. ███████ continuously claims he was effectively playing himself, which explains his shoddy acting. ██████████ plays ████'s buddy, the womanizing ██████████████ and ███████████ as the dumb blonde with telekinetic powers, █████████████ /><br />Although featuring various horror elements, such as a baby eye, an ape with mutating urine and a spontaneous detonating man, ████████████████ Darkplace's real appeal is in it's homage to bad television. Everything from the acting, to the editing, to the writing, to the music, to the special effects, to the white maverick aggravating his uptight black boss is all done to show up the godawful '80s shows shown only at eleven o'clock on weekdays.<br /><br />The show however is also a brilliant example of cult British sitcom. Unlike other shows such as The Mighty Boosh or The League of Gentlemen which spawned mass publicity, cult followings and travelling shows, ██████████████ only ran for one series and still survives due to its popularity among the fans. If you feel like something that transcends television genres with pitch perfection, find this show and watch it within the nest 24 hours . . .<br /><br />. . . 23 hours 59 minutes. Don't make me sit here and count.
