Wow this was a great movie! The acting and comedy was incredible, along with cutting edge (for its time) special effects. ████████████ and ███████████ are a hilarious duo, backed up by ██████████████ fantastic performance. I've seen this movie countless times, and it just gets better and better. The best of all time! They need to re-release it into theaters!
