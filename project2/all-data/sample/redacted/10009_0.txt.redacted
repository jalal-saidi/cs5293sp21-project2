LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is not your typical musical. That is, no one breaks out in song and dance. The numbers are used in the context of the story either in rehearsal or performance. This is a musical drama. Don't know how accurate the story is of ████████████ rise to fame with the help of her manager/gangster/husband, but for it's day, made in the 50's, it's quite blunt. █████████ and ████████████ have seldom been better, and they make a terrific combo. Also appealing is the underrated ████████████████, so good in HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE. Here he gives a laid back, easy going performance which is great contrast to the ████████████ character played by Cagney. Like in A STAR IS BORN, there really isn't anyone else of any importance in the movie. Just three or four main characters. To fully enjoy this movie, hope one has a wide screen TV for the full CinemaScope range. █████ system would also help. The musical numbers are brilliantly staged, both the big production number and Miss Days quieter moments. Correction in other peoples comments. █████████████ did not win her █████ for I'LL CRY TOMORROW released the same year as LOVE ME. She won a few years later for I WANT TO LIVE...also, someone said her voice was dubbed for I'LL CRY..not so. She did her own singing as ████████████...Miss ███████ WAS dubbed by ███████████, however, in WITH A SONG IN MY HEART... <br /><br />.
