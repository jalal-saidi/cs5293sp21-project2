This film is the story of 20's singer ███████████ and her marriage to ████████████. When █████ sings the old standards,it's great but MGM tacked on two numbers that sounded OK but they threw the ambiance off. It plays with the facts as usual,███████████ was well into her thirties before she went Hollywood. In real life ███████████ was a quiet,refined woman stuck in a bad marriage. Despite what the film says,████ had many friends who just accepted █████ as her husband. ████ was no ambitious tramp conniving people out of work so she could take their place but I guess it made a better story. The song Ten Cents a Dance was actually written for a stage show.
