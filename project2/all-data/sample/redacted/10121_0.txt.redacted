I loved this movie. I thought the banter between ██████ and ███████ were subtly hilarious. The facial expressions were spot on from Holden. Young was formidable in this part as well. I think it takes a strong cast to make a movie that revolves around four sole characters. It was a great romantic comedy. I liked the chemistry between ███████ and Young on screen. I also thought that █████████ added the right amount of drama/comedy to the whole show. I loved the scenes in the woods with ███████ and ██████ bickering and making their pleas to Young. All in all, I think this is a good movie, and definitely worth the time of watching.
