███████████████ makeup isn't frightening, but his eyes and facial expressions keep you on edge. █████████████ is working on a cure for cancer by FREEZING, Dr ███████ (█████████████) places his dying patient in an underground ice chamber carved out from a surrounding glacier. One of his patients die and █████ is in fear of being arrested. ███████ uses a powerful drug which puts █████ and his captors in an unconscious rest. Ten years after the disappearance of Dr. ███████, they discover the ice chamber containing the frozen bodies. The story progreses with ███████ going out of control experimenting with his prisoners, using them as his guinea pigs until he obtains the complete formula. All you can say about this picture is that █████ was trying to cure cancer the best way that he could in 1940.
