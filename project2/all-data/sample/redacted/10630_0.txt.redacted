███████████ is an isolated concert pianist who is swept into the lives of apartment house residents in "A Kiss in the Dark," also starring ██████████. █████ is excellent as a man who knows no other world than that of the concert stage and the practice room, and his handlers like it that way. When an apartment manager visits him, █████ learns that one of his investments is The Cleopatra Apartments. One look at ██████████ in her shorts and █████ decides not to be an absentee landlord.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining comedy, and I agree with previous posters that there are laugh out loud scenes. Some of the comedy is provided by, of all people, ██████████████████ as a subletter who works at night and sleeps -- or tries to -- all day. It's a different role for Crawford, and he does it very well.<br /><br />Wyman is very pretty and vivacious as an apartment dweller who falls for █████, and the two have wonderful chemistry. Handsome ████████████ is her insurance salesman boyfriend. This isn't the most fabulous film you'll ever see, but it's a fun one.
