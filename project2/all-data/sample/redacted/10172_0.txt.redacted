Out of all the Blackadder series, this one was my favourite. My favourite character in it was General ████████ excellently played by ███████████, but all of the other cast were down right brilliant as well. The writing was also top notch.<br /><br />It is World War 1. Captain ██████████ (██████████████) is in charge of a trench where the occupants are- the scruffy ████████ (█████████████) and the over enthusiastic ██████ (███████████). Away from the trenches is Blackadder's boss General ████████ (███████████) and Captain Darling (████████████). The final episode sees ██████████, ████████, ██████ and Darling go over the top and get killed. That moment in my opinion is the most dramatic moment in a sitcom.<br /><br />All six episodes of this were hilarious. No matter how many times you see them, you can't stop laughing. They are very clever, full of intellectual hilarious gags.<br /><br />Best Episode: Private Planes- Series 1 episode 4: For the excellent guest appearances of Bottom duo ██████████ and ███████████████.
