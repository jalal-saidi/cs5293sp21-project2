"The Fury" came out after ███████████████ classic, "██████." And like the previous film, it's about a girl with a mental ability, but she's far from alone.<br /><br />As the film opens, we find out that ████████████ (████████████████ been double crossed by his best friend (And fellow government agent) █████████ (███████████████). It seems that █████████ wants Peter's son █████ (██████████████), who has an amazing psychic ability. █████████ wants █████ so bad that he stages a shootout while they're in Israel and attempts to kill Peter (His son thinks he's dead).<br /><br />Peter turns up in Chicago sometime later, searching for his son and staying a step ahead from the government agents that want him out of the way. He finds out that ████████████████ (██████████████ be able to help him find him. ███████ is freaked out about her ability: whenever she touches someone, it causes them to bleed. Seeking help from The Paragon Institute, she soon finds out 2 things: █████ was there before her and that she has a connection to him. What she doesn't know is that █████████ has become interested in her abilities, and wants to replace █████ with her.<br /><br />Robin, meanwhile, has become increasingly unstable (Despite incredibly high dosages of medications that would kill a normal person, they have no effect on him at all)and increasingly dangerous (He's developed an ability to manipulate machines and doing the same to himself). He is so much of a threat that he causes a section of a ferris wheel to crash into a building because the guys were Middle Eastern (A trigger for what happened in Israel to his father).<br /><br />There are some plot holes that have nagged me (You would figure after the incident at the carnival that they would have had a clue to how increasingly dangerous he's become). The film gets bloody, but the ending in which ███████ causes the bad guy to explode (using her powers)is still effective (Keep in mind that this was 3 years BEFORE the exploding head scene in "Scanners"). Some of the content may be a bit "politically incorrect" in this post 9/11 society: █████'s actions at the carnival were triggered by what happened in Israel, even though these guys had nothing to do with what happened. So basically, █████ had committed a "hate crime," killing them because they were Middle Eastern men. <br /><br />Keep your eye out for ████████████, ███████████, █████████████ and ████████████ in small parts. And █████████████ fans will like the score to the film.
