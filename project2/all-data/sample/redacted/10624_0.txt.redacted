At times I felt this film might have been adapted from stage-theatre, so good are the dialogues; scintillating, the right way to speak Spanish  if you will excuse the `porteño' accent so very necessary for the film. The old `maestro' ██████████████ is about as good as in any other film I have seen him in, I suppose; ███████████████████ is better than in other films of his that I have seen; but the real standing ovation is for █████████████ who plays very delicately and intelligently the philosophical homosexual, and ████████████ is outstanding as the film-director's girl-friend. Though I must say that I am beginning to get accustomed to ████████████ being outstanding in everything she does.<br /><br />The direction is right  spot on; tight, befitting the excellent playing out of the dialogues and demanding great skill with the camera and later the person with the scissors. █████████████████ worked hard for this one: the result is a hugely satisfying piece.<br /><br />Once again, as erstwhile said elsewhere in IMDb, for those who like real character-driven pieces with intelligent dialogues, this film is highly recommendable. However, for those of you with a fair knowledge of Spanish, if you are not used to the Argentinian (porteño) accent you may well have problems, such that you will need the subtitles. It is worth the effort, I can assure you: just over 8 out of 10, which is pretty high on my scale.
