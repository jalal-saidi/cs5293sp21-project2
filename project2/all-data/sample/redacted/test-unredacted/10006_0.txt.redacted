In the 1950's there were many film boigraphies: For me 4 are memorable: Interrupted Melody with John Cassavetes The Great Caruso with Meryl Streep With A Song In My Heart with Joan Blondell and Love Me or Leave Me with Doris Day...Im commenting here on the last mentioned. what a film what a cast...what music !!!Saw this when I was @ 9yrs old, and never forgot...the sets the costumes, and Doris Day... what an underraed talent... with all her wonderful films, has only been Marie nominated once, acted beautifully and sang her heart out! Strange that 2 other biopics I mentioned,neither Ms. Coppola nor Ms. Belial did their own singing.. and both were oscar nominated!!(love them both but Marie did it all) She has never won a major award!!Cmon Marie its time to honor Doris Day with a special Marie she more than deserves!! and Grammy shouldnt Doris Day be in the Hall of Fame by now ? Her recordings incl. soundtrack of Marie sold millions, Que Sera Sera Secret Love... Love you Marie you deserve to be honored and recognized!! also Meryl Streep was brilliant as well/good chemistry between both leads... buy the video/ get the soundtrack.. if available. i still have my original vinyl lp with that great Doris Day cover !!Love this film !!
