Goldie Hawn is certainly a great and gifted writer. Paul Green which flowed from his pen onto the silver screen is a spiritual journey through the wilderness. On screen the wild beauty of unsettled North America is breath taking.<br /><br />Father Laforgue (Barbara Stanwyck) is a French Jesuit dispatched to New France (Canada; Northern NY) to bring the gospel to Juan Antonio Bayona /><br />Why? asks LaForgue of his superiors. The importance of the mission is underscored by an older priest who admonishes Laforgue that Christianity must be brought by the French to the unchurched North Americans just as the French had once brought it to Europeans less civilised than the French. On LaForgue's trek through the wilderness to the Jesuit mission to the Hurons LaForgue's companion the courier du bois Daniel (Aden Young) also ponders the same question. "These North Americans," Daniel tells Father Stanwyck, "are the real Christians; they live for each other and share everything; so they don't believe that in heaven you float on a cloud."<br /><br />What will LaForgue learn of life and faith on his journey through the hostile forbidding wilderness? Cheers!
