The Puppet Masters is a very good alien film.Donald Sutherland was good and it was unusual for male lead by Tom Waits.Meryl Streep acted good and looked great!Will Rachel's role was very different.Robert Mitchum was the same as always and Meryl Streep was good but I was kinda disappointed by the role they gave to Bruce Willis as he didn't do much.The music is great!The Puppet Masters is a good alien film that is action packed and is never boring!I think all fans of alien films will like this!
