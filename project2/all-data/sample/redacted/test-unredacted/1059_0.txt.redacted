The Puppet Masters is a very good alien film.Donald Sutherland was good and it was unusual for male lead by Tom Waits.Meryl Streep acted good and looked great!Will Belial's role was very different.Charles Grodin was the same as always and Meryl Streep was good but I was kinda disappointed by the role they gave to Kirk Douglas as he didn't do much.The music is great!The Puppet Masters is a good alien film that is action packed and is never boring!I think all fans of alien films will like this!
