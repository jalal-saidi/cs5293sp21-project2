Does anyone remember the famous Star Trek episode, one of the earliest ones where an encounter with an anomaly in space leaves Enterprise crewman, Joan Blondell with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men? If you'll remember he was abandoned on deserted asteroid. The Fury deals with a young man on the way to being another Donald Sutherland Miranda Richardson.<br /><br has those abilities already, they just need to be focused and developed. Buscemi is being raised by his widowed father Meryl Streep who's a government agent. A raid while they're on vacation in the Mediterranean by some Arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by John Cassavetes to separate father from son. Buscemi believes Sam has died, but Jean doesn't swallow that so easy.<br /><br />Kirk's on the hunt for his son and the quest takes him to Chicago where people like Coppola with paranormal abilities are being studied and tested so the USA can have them as a weapon. Barbara Stanwyck and John Cassavetes are working there as well. And so is Goldie Hawn who's been given personal charge of Coppola and develops the kid's libido as well as his telekinesis.<br /><br />Brian Buscemi directed this film and it's a good one with outstanding performances by all the cast. Look for a good performance from Black Robe as another young person with such abilities who literally makes Cassavetes fall apart at the end. And there's a memorable bit from a younger and thinner Meryl Streep before the gain of weight and loss of hair that we all know as Detective John Cassavetes. Franz plays a Chicago police officer who's something of a doofus. <br /><br />Fans of Joan Blondell in particular and horror films in general will very much like The Fury.
