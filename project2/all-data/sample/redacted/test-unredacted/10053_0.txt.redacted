Classic 90's time, this is one of those movies that I kind of remember seeing on TV five million times as a kid. I always loved watching it, it had the most incredible effects and I thought it was so funny. I was such a deranged 7 year old I guess. But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her. It has a very clever story, amazing effects and three great actors: Meryl Streep, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. Who said dark comedies can't be good? Death Becomes her shows the true competitive side of women that scares most of the human race, how far we will go to be the hottest, the smartest, the kindest, etc. But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.<br /><br />Actress John Cassavetes and writer Goldie Hawn are longtime rivals. Tommy's life falls apart when glamorous Peterson steals Marie's fiancé, plastic surgeon John Cassavetes, and marries him. Seven years later, Marie is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution. Obsessed with getting revenge against Stanwyck, she struggles in the institution with healing. Stanwyck's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career. Duvall, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician. When Peterson and Marie meet again at Marie's book-signing party, Marie appears miraculously rejuvenated, thin, and youthful. Peterson is first dumbfounded then jealous. As part of Marie's plan, she plays both Peterson and Rachel, telling them each she has never blamed them for her ruined love life. Stanwyck resorts to the aid of the mysterious Barbara Stanwyck, who claims she has discovered the secret of eternal youth. Stanwyck purchases the potion, drinks it, and is delighted to see her body visibly losing the signs of aging as she watches in a mirror, leaving her thin, firm, and young. Tommy, meanwhile, seduces Rachel and reveals to him a detailed and foolproof plot to kill Peterson. Bruce Willis.<br /><br />"Death is still alive Peterson kills Meryl Streep is still alive death has become them.<br /><br />The film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Peterson and Marie were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further. As well as why we should care what is happening to these pretty horrible characters. But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV. I think it was a lot of fun and had some good laughs, especially the fight between Peterson and Marie, they discover that there's really no point to inflicting physical pain but keep going at it with each other. This is a recommendation to those who have a strange sense of humor, it's something only a few will get.<br /><br />7/10
