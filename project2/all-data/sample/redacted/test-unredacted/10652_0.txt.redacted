The marriage of a bickering couple in a fantasy-version of Las Vegas comes to a boil when the wife decides to leave (she wants a little excitement, but hubby is a homebody); both he and she link up with other partners, but will married-love win out? Michael Peterson and Tom Waits star in this lavishly-designed, studio-shot concoction from director Francis Ford Coppola, who seemingly put all his heart into the unreality of the film's look and forgot to shape the characters (and involve the audience). There's nobody here worth giving a damn about, not Coppola nor Jean, nor their new paramours, Latin smoothie Black Robe or pixieish showgirl Barbara Stanwyck (who has the film's best scene walking a tightrope, which may have been stolen from "King of Hearts"). The country music by Tom Waits and Carl Weathers hopes to work as a narrative theme, when actually a stronger screenplay might have sufficed. * from ****
