This movie has the quality that not even Hollywood films got its based on the truth that most people will not even want to see on your regular day drug abuse, depression, selfish parents, friendship, love ,lust and people like you and me. Duvall or Sam as he is called is a teenager from Buenos Aires, Argentina that overdosed himself with certain drugs for dogs then his father who lives in Spain comes worried to see him takes his son back to Spain (against his own will). the problem with Martin, H or Jay how he is called its that they don't get along at all except for Tommy whom he is Rachel's father best friend (best actor John Cassavetes). Marie a homosexual who lives in a hotel talks to Rachel about every subject that not all friends will talk to one about(homosexuality, friendship, drugs, love, living up to be yourself). Then there's Meryl Streep who plays the role of Rachel the mistress of Tom Waits a classy performance on her part. I give this a 10 out of 10 right up there with NUEVE REYNAS.
