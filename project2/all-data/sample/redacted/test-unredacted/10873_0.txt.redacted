The boss of an institute for psychic researches of the American government discovers that his own son and a girl are being sought by terrorists who want to use their mind's powers.Narrative conducted in an agile and suffocating way by the veteran Ben Lyon, responsible for equally violent and full of action classic such as "The Untouchables". In this thriller marked by a great dramatic charge, the excellent supporting cast's work ( beginning with Michael Peterson,who has the most shocking, unpleasant and courageous scene , and with John Cassavetes, who shows talent in a serious part, different from the characters that made his fame:he became well-known for doing partner's roles in some Charles Grodin movies, but here he offers a discreet, silent interpretation) sustains the interest for this confused but well developed and touching story. As already demonstrated in his previous works, the violence in De Palma's films is never gratuitous, however it is always true and raw.
