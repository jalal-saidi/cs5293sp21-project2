It is amazing to see all the things you have read all your life in the big screen. It is not only the characters, but also all the background is related to the comic (and all the little details you can find).<br /><br />I had seen no movie where you could find so few differences between the comic and the film (much much better than Asterix and Rachel, where the things look quite strange).<br /><br />And the best of all: The actor playing Verhoeven is really Verhoeven (same face, same voice, everything!! is like the comic).
