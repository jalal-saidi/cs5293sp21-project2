Hmm..this was a Cannell (sp?)series = like "Wiseguy" was... Did Goldie Hawn use the name of "Donald Sutherland" in bit roles? There's no activity for this "Donald Sutherland" guy after '92-'93, and I think Goldie Hawn died in l993. NO photo exists of "Donald Sutherland" either, as far as I can find out with a Google. If anyone knows, let me know = I'm a Goldie Hawn collector...<br /><br />"Renegade" was a great series = with an excellent cast. We came across it and watched it with relish... it really entertained us for the hour it was on. DAILY.. (Mon-Friday) (watched it on USA network a few years ago). <br /><br />Sad when Peterson left -sad when the dam series ENDED. "Dutch" Dixon was always a special treat...as far as I know, we saw the entire series. Highly enjoyable, Wish something (ANYthing) were this interesting these days on television.
