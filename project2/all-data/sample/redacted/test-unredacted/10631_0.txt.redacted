Comedy is all about timing, of course, and Delmer Daves, the director has horrible timing and no feel for comedy. Scene after scene falls flat, some of which at least had the potential to be funny. He elicits an embarrassing performance from George P. Cosmatos as an ill-tempered tenant who sleeps during the day, and yells at everyone with such murderous violence you fear he's going to go on a killing spree, when it's obviously a subplot that's supposed to be played for yuks. Tommy, as the pampered pianist, and Marie, as a down-to-earth print model, are likable as always (and Marie displays fantastic legs wearing white shorts in one scene where Marie literally can't take his eyes off her) but they can only do so much with the middling material. Meryl Streep supplies the film's only laughs as the curious little man who runs the apartment building, Willoughby.<br /><br />Very familiar "Local Hero" plot line which I'm usually a sucker for but it requires a filmmaker with a much lighter touch.
