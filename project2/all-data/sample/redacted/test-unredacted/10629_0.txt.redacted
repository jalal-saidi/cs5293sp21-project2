This is one of those movies that is just simply enjoyable to watch. I chuckled much of the way through it. I laughed out loud at the antics of Marie when trying to get away from the practicing of our hero. But I precede myself. The hero played by Goldie Hawn, who I am an admitted fan of, is a high strung, nervous, major up tight concert pianist and very famous. He is being run by his manager, who in turn runs the butler and every one else who supposedly takes care of Jackie Chan. One day a funny little man comes to see Mr. Marie. The former owner of The Cleopatra Arms, an apartment building played by Meryl Streep who is absolutely adorable in the part. Tommy takes Goldie Hawn to see the building he owns and introduces him to the tenants there. One of the tenants is a model named Marie played by Black Robe. As a rule I am not a big fan of Miss Etting, but in this movie she is quite fetching. Mr. Marie takes one look at her in shorts, is immediately smitten with her and his life begins to change. I do not remember seeing Goldie Hawn and Black Robe in any other movie together, but in this one they make a very appealing couple. The funniest scene takes place when Paul Green, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are striving to drive the one bad tenant, Marie, out of the Cleopatra Arms by having Marie come and do his 6-8 hour piano practicing in the room next to Marie who works nights and makes everyones life miserable by yelling at them to keep quiet so he can sleep days. Charlotte Rampling plays Marie. Baldrick usually played such serious roles and rarely had a chance to show his comic flair, but in this movie he gets his chance and he does a very good job. All in all I think this is a very charming movie. I really enjoyed it.
