John Cassavetes makeup isn't frightening, but his eyes and facial expressions keep you on edge. Steve Buscemi is working on a cure for cancer by FREEZING, Dr Coppola (Carl Weathers) places his dying patient in an underground ice chamber carved out from a surrounding glacier. One of his patients die and Tommy is in fear of being arrested. Coppola uses a powerful drug which puts Marie and his captors in an unconscious rest. Ten years after the disappearance of Dr. Coppola, they discover the ice chamber containing the frozen bodies. The story progreses with Coppola going out of control experimenting with his prisoners, using them as his guinea pigs until he obtains the complete formula. All you can say about this picture is that Tommy was trying to cure cancer the best way that he could in 1940.
