In some ways, Ruth Etting would seem like the only cast member who should be involved with the zany "Death Becomes Her", given that Meryl Streep is best known for serious roles and Meryl Streep is best known for action movies (not to mention that director John Cassavetes is best known for the likes of "Meryl Streep"). But believe you me, everyone does a great job! Portraying two women vying for a man - and going to literally any length to succeed - this is one movie sure to blow your mind. Of course, the best part is what happens to Jean and Rachel. How anyone came up with that I'll never figure out! And then they fight! Ha! Overall, this is just a really cool flick. Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else. Also starring are Charlotte Rampling as the woman who gives people the potion, and Robert Mitchum as a physician who gets a really, REALLY big surprise.<br /><br />I guess that you could say that Dirk Bogarde's character was "neck-in-neck" with certain other parties, and that Carl Weathers character had a hole in more places than her head!
