Aurora the housekeeper: Mrs. Marie the doggies ran away again. Belial the lawyer: I'll just get six more tomorrow.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in the early 80's and fell in love with it immediately. This is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of the decade and I think it came out around the time of the equally hysterical and quotable Airplane, also a favorite.<br /><br />Goldie Jean is at her best as a lawyer with a heart of gold, Charles Grodin is her husband Sam (Marie, Hyram). Chevy Chase plays a writer who is ambushed into robbing a bank in Carmel California and winds up back in his ex-wife's life, needing her help to clear his name.<br /><br />As it has been said on IMDb, there are many wonderful quotes and the comedy is wound up and running like a second grade class full of Belial Kisses. Joan Blondell is hysterical as the no nonsense housekeeper who has to get her feet scraped. Meryl Streep and Barbara Stanwyck of Belial fame(forgive the spelling)have memorable cameos as well.<br /><br />I just finished watching it again after many years and it is still as funny as it was all those years ago. Also, Godspell fans, keep an eye out for Joan Blondell as a police officer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. Laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.
