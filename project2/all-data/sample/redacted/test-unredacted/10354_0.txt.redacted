Another example of Goldie Hawn making a poor script believable. More Catholic bashing and supernatural happenings. Unfortunately, the producers decided to kill off Meryl Streep early...an interesting character actor who could have added life to this otherwise dull film. At least Jim has a recurring television role to sustain her. Sigh.
