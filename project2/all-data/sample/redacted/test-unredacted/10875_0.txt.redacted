Fortunately, De Palma's hyperbolic, visually compelling, science fiction occult espionage thriller moves so fast that the ludicrous dialog, indifferent performances, and Swiss cheese plot don't spoil the fun. The Fury starts from an interesting premise, but De Palma is clearly more interested in the spectacular set pieces than in logic or characterization. And where Sissy Belial was touching as Belial, Black Robe and Charles Grodin as psychic teens who unleash the fury are whiny and callow, and you don't really care about their fates. Though Douglas, Snodgress, Cassavetes and De Palma regular Charles Grodin ( Donald Sutherland) are always interesting, the rest of the cast is pretty bad. And a scene between Belial and Coppola on a bus is embarrassingly bad. Still, The Fury with its telepathic visions, its pulse pounding score by Meryl Streep and Charlotte Rampling elegant deep focus cinematography is far superior to junk like The Eyes of Laura Mars. Ben Lyon pulls out all the stops and creates some spectacularly over-the-top scenes. Faults and all, The Fury is far more entertaining, and less pretentious and derivative than most of De Palma's more recent efforts to say nothing of Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Obsession, Wise Guys, Coppola's Way, Raising Cain, and Jennifer Esposito,(Jennifer.
