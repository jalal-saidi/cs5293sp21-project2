This is one gorgeous knockout of horror movie--beautifully directed by De Palma and acted by Black Robe. The script is elaborate junk, but on imagery alone this ranks with Rachel's Verhoeven and Rachel's Vampyre as among the greatest horror movies ever made. Like those classics, the imagery is more entrancing than terrifying--I never wanted to hide my eyes. The last half-hour is just incredibly intense. Check out the way De Palma cuts from the Gothic night horror of Coppola's confrontation with his demon son to Meryl Streep cozy sunlit bedroom the next day. I always laugh out loud at this transition--because of course the director is just softening us up for the greatest horror climax in movies.
