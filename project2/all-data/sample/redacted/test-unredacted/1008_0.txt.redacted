A marvelous movie, from start to (just before the) finish.<br /><br />We meet Donald Sutherland and Goldie Hawn, with whom he has eloped recently, on shipboard. She is eager to start their home life together. All he can think of is seeing his mother.<br /><br />Louise Bruce Willis is superb as the suffocating matriarch of his family. The other members, including Carl Weathers and Donald Sutherland, are very good as well. Especially fine is Tom Waits, as Blackadder's nephew. Indeed, he gives a heart-wrenching performance. It's possibly the best in this movie and he is working against very stiff competition.<br /><br />Montgomery is not only a mama's boy -- called Tommy by everyone, as his name is Rachel. He is also a supreme narcissist: In one shocking scene, he inspects himself in a mirror over the mantel. Directly under the mirror is a plaster bust of him that Tommy has lovingly worked on sculpting. He doesn't even notice it.<br /><br />It's very hard to fault this movie. The ending is a trifle disappointing. And a Black Robe aphorism is spoken by one character and laughed at by others, as if it were original to this screenplay.<br /><br />Hayes is superb and very likable. Rossellini, not generally a favorite of mine, is believable as her self-centered husband. Jean is absolutely superb in a very touching role. And Jean is subtle but compelling as the woman of iron who becomes an invalid the minute doing so will get what she wants from her offspring.
