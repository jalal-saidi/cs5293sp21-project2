this movie was Excellent.. lots of excitement... and scary at the same time.. i really enjoyed it.. but the only thing i didnt like about it was Black Robe.. shes not one of my favourite actresses.. but Dirk Bogarde's and Meryl Streep were very good in this one..<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie..
