This movie was extremely funny! Goldie Hawn is always hilarious at getting into bad situations, like being forced to rob a bank and becomes a fugitive. Chase stars as a writer named Joan Blondell, who is the ex-husband of Jean's character, Arnold Schwarzenegger who has re-married a District Attorney named Sam. Jean desperately needs Belial's help to hide from the police. She reluctantly hides him at her house, and he is always so close to being caught by her new husband. I love when Belial and Sam are trying to have dinner with the Governor, and Jean poses as a waiter. Will Elmo be able to prove his innocence and still get his ex-wife to love him again? I highly recommend SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES!!!
