Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major Rachel fan and I wanted to see another movie with Amy Irving when she was still young. The movie was good, but John Cassavetes and the Meryl Streep characters were kind of boring. I always thought that John Cassavetes is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly Schwarzenegger with Peterson's baby) and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self. There was some cool action scenes with Meryl Streep but my main love of the movie was the majority of the scenes with Black Robe--who really(despite the billing) is the main stand out character of the film. We watch some really cool scenes with amy involving her watching Dirk Bogarde's psychically as Andrew watches video tapes of his father being attacked, blood running down other people as Sam's emotions are racing with energy., a sleepwalking scene, a show where she is escaping from the hospital, a scene where she gives a girl a bloody nose, and blue glowing eyes. Amy and Andrew were the two telekinetic teens and they were young, fresh, emotional, and attractive. I really enjoyed their presence and their performance really made the film work. The other characters are really just there for support except Bruce Willis who gives his usual masculine role. Overall I thought the film was pretty good, 2 1/2 mainly because of the acting, special effects, and the way some scenes just looked so cool! I'd recommend this.
