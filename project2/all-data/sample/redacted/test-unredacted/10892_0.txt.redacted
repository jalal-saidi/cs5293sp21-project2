John Cassavetes plays Charles Grodin (best-selling author, creator of this fictional TV show and . . . . dreamweaver) who plays Dr. Meryl Streep M.D. in the short-lived, cult show that was called, funnily enough, "Barbara Stanwyck DarkPlace". 6 episodes of genuinely inspired barmy brilliance, interspersed with comments from those who were there (with the exception of Charles Grodin, who played Tom Waits and then went missing and is presumed dead).<br /><br />Absolutely brilliant and pant-wettingly funny, it's the little touches that make "Barbara Stanwyck DarkPlace" such a joy to watch. Whether it's cats being thrown out of doors, clumsy cuts to a woman with mascara smeared all over her face to show the upset she has just endured or terribly inept timing in the acting department, this movie feels like a real, low-budget product of the late-70s/early-80s.<br /><br />Matthew Holness deserves most of the praise for his writing and portrayal of the egomaniacal Tommy himself but he wouldn't have a show without the superb support from Black Robe (hilariously cool and cocky), Charles Grodin (bravely portraying the worst actor of the bunch) and Black Robe (as the lovely Sam, a woman no less and "I hope that's not a problem").<br /><br />The script is a platinum-plated gem and every other line will have you stifling another big laugh. In fact, this series probably has more laughs per minute than any other viewing experience outside of the classic ZuckerAbrahamsZucker movies. If, like me, you had not heard of this before coming across it somewhere online then do catch up with it now. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />See this if you like: "Dr. Stanwyck's House Of Horrible", "Sapphire & Steel", "Look Around You".
