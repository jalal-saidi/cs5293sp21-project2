Wimpy Bruce Willis (the likable Goldie Hawn), his scrappy tomboy best friend Arnold Schwarzenegger (an appealingly spunky performance by Donald Sutherland), and four of Marie's obnoxious college classmates go to a remote cabin in the woods owned by Marie's stepfather to party hearty. Things go sour when a vicious werewolf shows up and kills everyone except for Marie and Sam. Tommy suspects that the werewolf is really his mean, jerky, abusive step dad Robert Mitchum (excellently played to the sneering hateful hilt by Carl Weathers). Tommy, Sam, and Marie's uncle Rachel (the solid Donald Sutherland) all join forces to try to figure out a way to stop Toblat before he kills again. Writer/director Barbara Stanwyck offers a fresh and novel spin on the standard werewolf premise by cleverly blending the more horrific elements with a surprisingly potent and touching domestic drama. The main characters are unexpectedly engaging (Jim in particular is simply awesome, thanks mainly to Marie's winningly sparky portrayal of her), the acting overall acceptable, and the story unfolds at a constant steady pace. Popping up in nice cameos are Meryl Streep as grubby hick Carl Weathers and Robert Mitchum as friendly Sheriff Tom Waits. The nasty, hulking, wisecracking werewolf makes for a ferocious and frightening monster: the savage beast rips off heads, tears people to pieces, rapes women, and even brutally castrates one poor guy (ouch!). Tom Waits spooky'n'shuddery score, Charlotte Rampling bright, polished cinematography, and the funky special effects are all uniformly up to par. Moreover, we even get plenty of unflinchingly graphic gore, a pleasing amount of tasty female nudity, a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black twisted humor, and even some soft-core sex. A nifty little sleeper.
