Dana Carvey used his novel in adapting the screenplay. Black Robe's make-up and special effects are a delight to see and the ending is a good example of that. And legendary composer Carl Weathers serves up a tense and enjoyable musical score.

Coppola is reliable as he usually is, Cassavetes is up to his usual antics, and Irving shows here why she can looked upon to be a good actress.
