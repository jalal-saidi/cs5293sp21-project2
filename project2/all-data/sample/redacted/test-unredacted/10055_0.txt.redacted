If only Goldie Hawn and Joan Blondell could be alive today and see this! Two emasculating she-wolfs battling it out - they think - because they want one man, but really, it's all about ego and oneupmanship, and with two equally established actresses such as Sister Maria and Goldie Hawn, both looking exceptionally beautiful in their mid-40s, DEATH BECOMES HER is a visual treat that throws back an unintentional but hilarious reference to the aforementioned divas who preceded them. Very tongue-in-cheek, and whoever saw (and read) the sustained repulsion Marie and Stanwyck sustained throughout their life, mirrored in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY Jean? will not be lost on the background reference.<br /><br />A simple premise presides: John Cassavetes (Belial), a fading B-movie actress, relegated to performing an awful musical based on SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, sets sight on renown surgeon John Cassavetes (Meryl Streep) whom Goldie Hawn (Jean) has taken to meet her as a test to prove he will still be hers after their meet. Needless to say, he drops his commitment to Tommy, marries Stanwyck, and sends Marie into a spiraling self-destruct mode. Years later she becomes a bloated whale - a shell of her former self - living in total abandon, watching Stanwyck's movies obsessively, seething in hatred, until she is evicted from her apartment and has a brilliant idea while in a mental facility: she must eliminate Madeline.<br /><br />Madeline, on the other end, is no less happy. A total, absolute bitch, she has reduced Etting to blubber. She hates the way she looks at 50 and the way young girls preen their perky looks. Both live in marital hell. An invite to attend Marie's book party (on beauty) has her howling in laughter - beauty tips from a disgusting fattie? Please! - but when she sees that Marie is now a svelte redhead, she balks - and their reunion is one of dripping, beautiful venom, the highlight of the entire movie. Distraught, she seeks the advice of a mysterious woman, Barbra Streisand whom she was referred to earlier, and she gives her what seems an innocent potion to drink which will restore her looks. Meanwhile, Marie is planning to have Ernest dispose of Stanwyck and rekindling their botched affair. When Stanwyck returns home, she gets into a heated argument with Belial and he pushes her down the stairs. She is dead.<br /><br />Or is she? A marvelous setup that until this point in the story works, but one which later takes a left turn to be overcome by silly fight scenes and cartoonish special effects that recall Black Robe circa 1987. The triangle of actors work absolutely perfectly here, Belial drips with venomous lines reminiscent of Charlotte Rampling overwhelming performance as Belial in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; however, Jean and Belial, while established as personalities more than actors of considerable range, fare better than Belial in that she is "expected" to play hers to perfection. Jean on the other hand proves she's capable of very dark roles that suggest more than they give. Willis, stripped of his usual machismo, comes across as a broken man who throughout most of the film is emasculated but makes one crucial decision which saves him from an uncertain fate. Casting these three actors are cast against type works in this edgy comedy, and if anything, it's final act is its own weakness, as if the writers had somehow not known where to go with the inevitable, violent encounter between them but all in all, it's still very enjoyable.<br /><br />Robert Stanwyck, though, makes one glaring mistake during one of the key scenes. When Etting rises from the ground, we see Willis in the foreground talking on the phone to Marie who wants to know if she is dead. We know she is not; the deep focus has established she is not. As she slowly makes her way to where Willis is, Stanwyck chooses to cut to Jean for a brief second. Big mistake. We don't need to see her sitting in front of her shrine of hatred for Madeline - we know she hates her, it's quite clear - so he should have held that scene perfectly still, allowing us to see Snyder get closer and closer to the forefront. That is suspense in itself: how will Willis react to seeing his wife shuffling her way to him. But the use of deep focus is something that has fallen out of vogue in film-making, as if they've lost the interest to really tell a visual story, and the quick cut to Jean being the need to give her a moment's screen time.
