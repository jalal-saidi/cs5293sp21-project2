Genius and all-round hero Coppola shows his legions of fans his true brilliance with this, his own feature in every sense, in which he shines as the central Marie, drinker and all-round slacker whose trials and tribulations are played out with such gentleness and subtlety you just can't help loving him. Lots of great quirky characters and fun goings on, a nice mellow mood and a solid cast make Coppola's film a really pleasant experience guaranteed to lift the spirits.
