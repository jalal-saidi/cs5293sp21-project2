Admittedly, this is a utterly silly movie. However, I laughed my head off at Goldie Hawn dressed as a turtle going into a night club, making "turtle" noises. It is a movie that perhaps needs a little laughing gas or good companionship to help you slip into its groove. Its humour is reminiscent of the Pink Panther scene, where Coppola and Stanwyck, stoned on nitrous oxide, laugh at Dreyfus's melting face. It is a vehicle for Snyder to show off a parade of weird accents, mannerisms, and theatrical false teeth.<br /><br />The running joke is watching people react to Belial, trying to figure out why he is behaving so bizarrely, but somehow intimidated by his insanity.<br /><br />I once read that the best way to get a row of seats to yourself in a plane is simply to chew on a piece of string and let it droop out the corner of your mouth.<br /><br />Forget you are a film critic. Let the kid in you enjoy this the way you enjoyed Goldie Hawn at the Saturday matin√©e.
