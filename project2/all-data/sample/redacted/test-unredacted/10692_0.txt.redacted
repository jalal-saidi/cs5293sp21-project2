This powerful exposition ultimately demonstrates how moralist prejudice drives administration of the law in at least parts of the American heartland. Director Baldrick obviously has condensed the trial and chosen scenes to further his point of view but much of the evidence and many of the submissions had no place in a trial seeking truth and justice. Baldrick did not stage events that showed the prosecutors creating jury prejudice, he reported on them.<br /><br />Judge Belial allowed an immunized gay hooker to testify about Internet chats with Stanwyck. The only purpose was to demean Baldrick for his sexual interests. It certainly was not to add information about a homicide because the witness had never met Baldrick face to face nor had any direct contact with the defendant or his family. The only information he could provide about the Baldrick's marriage was Coppola's repeated statements about love for his wife Stanwyck. Similarly, evidence about gay pornography on Stanwyck's computer was, by itself, prejudicial. No testimony supported the notion that the material offended the dead woman but assistant prosecutor Ruth Etting certainly was highly offended by what she called filth.<br /><br />The prosecution failed to establish a believable motive for murder of Donald Sutherland. They suggested she was soon to lose her lucrative employment and that might cause Stanwyck to prefer her dead. Alternatively, they said that Baldrick might have been so offended by newly discovering his gay interest that she would end their relationship.<br /><br />The most egregious act of the prosecution was to claim parallels between Stanwyck's 2001 death with the death of a Stanwyck family friend in Germany in 1985. Her death 18 years before Stanwyck's trial was found by investigation at the time to be by natural causes. <br /><br />Lestrade's film is probably most powerful in the way it presents the Stanwyck family dynamics. The natural and adopted children stood by the defendant throughout the trial and that presents the strongest evidence of innocence.<br /><br />Despite my comments above, I am not convinced that Barbara Stanwyck is innocent. However, I do believe that the trial did not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
