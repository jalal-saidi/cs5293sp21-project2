This powerful exposition ultimately demonstrates how moralist prejudice drives administration of the law in at least parts of the American heartland. Director ████████ obviously has condensed the trial and chosen scenes to further his point of view but much of the evidence and many of the submissions had no place in a trial seeking truth and justice. ████████ did not stage events that showed the prosecutors creating jury prejudice, he reported on them.<br /><br />Judge ██████ allowed an immunized gay hooker to testify about Internet chats with ████████. The only purpose was to demean ████████ for his sexual interests. It certainly was not to add information about a homicide because the witness had never met ████████ face to face nor had any direct contact with the defendant or his family. The only information he could provide about the ████████'s marriage was ███████'s repeated statements about love for his wife ████████. Similarly, evidence about gay pornography on ████████'s computer was, by itself, prejudicial. No testimony supported the notion that the material offended the dead woman but assistant prosecutor ███████████ certainly was highly offended by what she called filth.<br /><br />The prosecution failed to establish a believable motive for murder of █████████████████. They suggested she was soon to lose her lucrative employment and that might cause ████████ to prefer her dead. Alternatively, they said that ████████ might have been so offended by newly discovering his gay interest that she would end their relationship.<br /><br />The most egregious act of the prosecution was to claim parallels between ████████'s 2001 death with the death of a ████████ family friend in Germany in 1985. Her death 18 years before ████████'s trial was found by investigation at the time to be by natural causes. <br /><br />Lestrade's film is probably most powerful in the way it presents the ████████ family dynamics. The natural and adopted children stood by the defendant throughout the trial and that presents the strongest evidence of innocence.<br /><br />Despite my comments above, I am not convinced that ████████████████ is innocent. However, I do believe that the trial did not prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
