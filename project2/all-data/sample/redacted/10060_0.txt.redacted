There is so much greatness in this unexpected Hollywood comedy that the cheap shots are really cheap and, quite frankly, unbearable. Buried somewhere between the special effects (extraordinary by the way) is one the wittiest satires to come out of Hollywood in many, many moons. ████████████ is sensational and ████████████ is, I swear, unrecognizable in the best possible way. The movie hits the highest moments when, for instance, █████ asks ███████████████████ how much the magic potion costs and ████████ replays: "Oh the sordid topic of coin" sublime, exquisite, funny but with enormous regard for its audience. But when █████ calls ███████████ to explain the "incident" at home he goes through a TV style monologue that seems to belong to a sit-com and not to the elegant vulgarity of this three sad, magnificent wannabees. The dialog, for the most part, is the best in any American serious comedy since ████████████. The structure of the script is flawless and inventive. The costumes are atrocious and certain scenes seem directed by a 3rd assistant. I don't know how to explain it. However, I have it, I own it and sometimes I put it on with my finger in the fast forward. What's good is so good that makes the whole thing really worth it.
