A not completely lousy movie from ███████████████! That said, the promise this movie has is never fulfilled. What could have been a Lewtonesque study of a man's breakdown degenerates into a silly sub par horror film. ████████████ plays a career obsessed banker who finds himself becoming even more obsessed with getting rid of a pesky rat that's invaded his swank brownstone (actually more of a mod pad with a castle-like facade). Director ████████, never one known for showing much tact, keeps the game of cat and mouse interesting for a good while until it just gets boring. Frankly, this is the type of movie with a "less is more approach" would need a star far more compelling than ██████. He's not bad, but he is dull and his jokey dialog doesn't help. █████████████ plays his wife and looks dynamite, but really has nothing to do. █████████████ is OK as ██████'s smitten co-worker. Judged next to other ████████ fare (anyone for COBRA?), it's a masterwork.
