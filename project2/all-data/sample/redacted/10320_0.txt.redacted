Ozon seems to have made here, what he couldn't quite succeed with See The Sea. ████████████████████ performance is so amazing it hurts. But the real credit should be given to ████ himself. It's surprising for a director of his age to make a film so economic, so mature and hiding the director from the viewer when it's all depending on the director. It's a master's work. It's ███████████████ masterpiece. a touching drama about a woman's denial of her loss, an everyday habit maybe like mentioned in the "waves". the last shot of ██████████████████ running on the sands towards the illusion of her husband is amazing. and how ozon cuts it before she ever reaches.
