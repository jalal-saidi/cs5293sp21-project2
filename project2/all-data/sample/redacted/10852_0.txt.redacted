Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major ██████ fan and I wanted to see another movie with ██████████ when she was still young. The movie was good, but ███████████████ and the ████████████ characters were kind of boring. I always thought that ███████████████ is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly ██████████████ with ████████'s baby) and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self. There was some cool action scenes with ████████████ but my main love of the movie was the majority of the scenes with ██████████--who really(despite the billing) is the main stand out character of the film. We watch some really cool scenes with amy involving her watching ██████████████ psychically as Andrew watches video tapes of his father being attacked, blood running down other people as ███'s emotions are racing with energy., a sleepwalking scene, a show where she is escaping from the hospital, a scene where she gives a girl a bloody nose, and blue glowing eyes. Amy and Andrew were the two telekinetic teens and they were young, fresh, emotional, and attractive. I really enjoyed their presence and their performance really made the film work. The other characters are really just there for support except ████████████ who gives his usual masculine role. Overall I thought the film was pretty good, 2 1/2 mainly because of the acting, special effects, and the way some scenes just looked so cool! I'd recommend this.
