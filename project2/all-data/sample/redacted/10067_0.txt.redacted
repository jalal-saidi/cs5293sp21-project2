If you like the Comic, you will like the film. █████████████ and Comapny have made the perfect film of Mortadelo and Filemon (Clever and Smart, etc). █████████████ is the perfect actor for █████████ because he is Mortadelo, and we can't forget Filemon, a great ████████████ who makes a great performance too. But even the Super and the Profesor Bacterio are as I have imagined them. They have done a great job recreating the inventations and all the items that are in the comics. You can see the Eskimo, and a lot of nonsense in the set, like signs, draws, etc...<br /><br />The Plot is very funny, the seed of the film is the comic ██████████████████, one of the masterpieces of Ibañez, in where you can see the Tirania Dictator, and a lot of inventions.<br /><br />A Must see for all the Real Fans.
