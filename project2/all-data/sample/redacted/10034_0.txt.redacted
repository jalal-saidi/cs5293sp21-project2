From ███████████████ (Back to the Future, ████████████), this is a fantastic black fantasy comedy with great stars and story. Basically ███████████████ (Golden Globe nominated ████████████) finds ████████████████ (███████████████████, you see her great arse and cleavage) who has a potion to make her younger, stop ageing, and avoid death. When she gets home, her man Dr. ███████████████ (████████████) has plans to kill her and be with ███████████ (███████████). But obviously the potion rescues ████████ from a broken neck, and she is still walking, with her head twisted backwards. Soon after, █████ also takes the potion, and avoids a large gun shot in her stomach. Towards the end, ██████ can't handle being with either of them, and after they co-operate, and ██████ finally dies (naturally), it ends with them finally falling apart, but ████████ still gets a good final line. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Very good!
