At its most basic, "Rachel and the Stranger" is a domestic comedy set in the wilderness of 18th century Ohio. Director █████████████ manages to pack more charm into each five minutes than most films have during their entire running length. <br /><br />At its most ambitious, "Rachel and the Stranger" is an allegorical story about the impact of a catalyst into a seemingly stable dynamic. In this case the stranger in the title, ███ (██████████████), visits the isolated farm of long-time friend ████████████ (██████████████), his young son Davey (█████████), and their bond servant ██████ (█████████████). █████ bought ██████ (who is working off her late father's debts) after his wife died, needing a replacement to help raise █████. He married her out of respect for social convention but has no intention of consummating the marriage. <br /><br />While David treats Rachel with respect and consideration, his son is openly resentful of the substitute mother. After some initial progress the threesome settles into a distanced existence, a rut from which there is little chance they will be able to escape on their own. But things quickly change when ███ stops by on his way to town. For the first time ██████ has someone who actively engages her. ███'s attentions build up ██████'s status in █████'s eyes while causing David to see her obvious attractions for the first time. But Foster doesn't limit things to this predictable interplay; he builds on it by having ██████ quickly come out of her guarded shell in response to ███'s interest. Even the makeup people get into the act as Young goes from the look of a plain pioneer woman to a subtle radiance.<br /><br />All four stars are excellent. It was probably ██████'s best performance as he provides most of the humor with his growing attraction to ██████ and his increasing irritation with the attention ███ is paying to her. <br /><br />Young was about 10 years too old for her 25 year-old character but this is not really a factor as the age of the character is unimportant; you wonder why they did not simply change the one reference to her age after casting Young for the part. Young's acting tends to be underrated because of her later work as a television hostess but even her film work as a teenager was extraordinary. She was an especially good casting choice because the repressed ██████ needs to subtly convey a depth and dimensionality early in the film to make her later transformation plausible.<br /><br />Mitchum gives perhaps his liveliest performance as he seems to be having a lot of fun with his part. Gray is solid as always, one of those rare child actors who were not irritating after a few minutes on the screen.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
