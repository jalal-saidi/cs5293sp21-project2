An interesting British entry to say the least dating from those dim dark days when ████████████████ was still '█████' but at least got a credit unlike █████████████. ██████████████ is top-billed and co-star ████████████ appeared in only a handful of films including Waterloo Road before falling off the radar for some 30 years but the film is unbalanced in the last third by a tour de force from ███████████████ in what is clearly a prototype ██████████████ - there is even a facial resemblance especially in the mouth between Thesiger and ████████████; both are aesthetes and both killers. This unbalance extends to the sets for whereas the three cafes that figure in the action are all utility Thesiger's apartment is well-appointed in the extreme. It's a fairly decent example of the innocent man caught at the scene of a crime, going on the run and taking up with a girl. Worth a look.
