I have loved this movie since I saw it in the early 80s when I was in Junior High. For 25 years I have liked to quoted this movie. Every actor was wonderful, and I find it difficult to pick one out as the best. ███████████ did such a great job, and he developed his character the best, I thought, as "███████" the klepto-chaeuffer. When "██████" told "Nick" to give himself up, she said "If you're innocent they will never send you to jail." ████ responds by asking "███████" if thats how it works, "███████" responds, "Not in my neighborhood." ██████████████ was great as "██████'s" husband "Ira." I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while ██████ was sitting on it. I loved that line, however, by Grodin where he said, "oh, he was limping. Then of course he's innocent, limper's never lie, limper's are famous for telling the truth." I highly recommend this.

The gas station attendant says "we don't keep cash at night, only credit cards." and then he says
